While you have not had too many interactions with Hobgoblins, Gordon Hobbs looks a bit dissimilar to what you would expect. The general features and size seems correct, but his skin- and haircolor are a bit more vivid - he is a ginger.

He has a long rifle on his back, a formula book in his pouch, and a bunch of vials with a weird translucent purple liquid on his belt.

Through the talks you have had with him he does seem to have the same intellect as is rumored of hobgoblins, and he has mentioned using a alchemical elixirs to keep him focused during the day.

While he sais that he's not young, he doesn't show any graying temples. The wrinkles he has looks more to be a part of his heritage than anything else.

Even at the worst of times he always seem to have a bit of a grin to him, and does like to joke around with the other in your adventuring troupe.
