# Enfeebled 1
![[systems-pf2e-icons-conditions-enfeebled.webp]]

You're physically weakened. Enfeebled always includes a value. When you are enfeebled, you take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Strength-based rolls and DCs, including Strength-based melee attack rolls, Strength-based damage rolls, and Athletics checks.
