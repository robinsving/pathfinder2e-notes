# Spell Effect: Resilient Touch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-lay-on-hands.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Lay on Hands]]_ if you have [[Resilient Touch]].

If the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC and a +1 status bonus to their saving throws until the end of their next turn.
