# Spell Effect: Rapid Adaptation (Desert)
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-oak-wreath-glow-green.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Rapid Adaptation]]_

The target isn't affected by severe or extreme heat, and when it rolls a success on an Acrobatics check to Balance on sand, it gets a critical success instead.
