# Spell Effect: Soothing Blossoms
![[icons-magic-nature-lotus-glow-pink.webp|150 lp right]]

When any creature in the area rolls a successful save against a poison or disease effect, it gets a critical success instead. The blossoms grant assisted recovery to everyone in the area to end their persistent damage, both when the spell is cast and at the start of each of your turns. This spell doesn't give a benefit on a save against an affliction unless the stage lasts 10 minutes or less.
