# Spell Effect: Shield
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shield.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Shield]]_

You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use. While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes.
