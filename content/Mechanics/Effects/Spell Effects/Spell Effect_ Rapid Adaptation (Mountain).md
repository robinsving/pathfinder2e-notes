# Spell Effect: Rapid Adaptation (Mountain)
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-oak-wreath-glow-green.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Rapid Adaptation]]_

The target isn't [[Off-Guard]] when Climbing, and when it rolls a success on an Acrobatics check to Balance on rubble, it gets a critical success instead.
