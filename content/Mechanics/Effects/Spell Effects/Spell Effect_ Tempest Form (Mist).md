# Spell Effect: Tempest Form (Mist)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tempest-form.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Tempest Form]]_

Your body becomes fluid to better suit your surroundings.

When you cast this spell, choose whether to become air, water, or mist. The spell gains the air trait if you choose air or mist, and the water trait if you choose water or mist.

You become amorphous, as does your armor. You lose any item bonus to AC and use your proficiency bonus for unarmored defense to determine your AC. You also gain resistance 10 to physical damage and become immune to precision damage. You can slip through tiny cracks and don't need to breathe. You can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait. You also gain the following effects based on your form.

**Mist**

*   You gain a Fly Speed of 20 feet, and it becomes hard to see through you.
*   Any creature on one side of your space who is targeted by a creature on the opposite side is [[Concealed]] to the targeting creature.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the resistance by 5.
