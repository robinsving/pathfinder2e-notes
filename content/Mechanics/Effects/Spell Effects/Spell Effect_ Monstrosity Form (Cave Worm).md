![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-monstrosity-form.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Monstrosity Form]]_

You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   20 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

*   **Cave Worm**
    *   Speed 40 feet, burrow Speed 30 feet, swim Speed 20 feet;
    *   **Melee** 1 jaws (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+20 piercing;
    *   **Melee** 1 stinger (agile, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8+15 piercing plus 2d6 persistent poison;
    *   **Melee** 1 body (reach 10 feet) **Damage** 2d8+20 bludgeoning;
    *   **Inexorable** You automatically recover from the [[Paralyzed]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], and [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] conditions at the end of each of your turns. You're also immune to being [[Immobilized]] and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25 temporary HP, attack modifier +31, increase damage by one damage die, and Athletics +33.
