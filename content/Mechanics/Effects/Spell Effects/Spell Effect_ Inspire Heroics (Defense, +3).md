# Spell Effect: Inspire Heroics (Defense, +3)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-inspire-heroics.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by critically succeeding on _[[Fortissimo Composition]]_ to enhance _[[Rallying Anthem]]_.

You inspire your allies to protect themselves more effectively. You and all allies in the area gain a +3 status bonus to AC and saving throws, as well as resistance equal to half the spell's level to physical damage.

_Note: resistance is not automatically added._
