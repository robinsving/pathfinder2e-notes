# Spell Effect: Impeccable Flow (Critical Failure Effect)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-impeccable-flow.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by critically failing _[[Impeccable Flow]]_

You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a -1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.
