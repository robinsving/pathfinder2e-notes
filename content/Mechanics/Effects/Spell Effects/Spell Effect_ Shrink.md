# Spell Effect: Shrink
![[icons-magic-unholy-strike-body-life-soul-purple.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Shrink]]_

You warp space to make a creature smaller. The target shrinks to become Tiny in size. Its equipment shrinks with it but returns to its original size if removed. The creature's reach changes to 0 feet. This spell has no effect on a Tiny creature.
