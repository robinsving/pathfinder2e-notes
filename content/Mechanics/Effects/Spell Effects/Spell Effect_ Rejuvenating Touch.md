# Spell Effect: Rejuvenating Touch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-lay-on-hands.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Lay on Hands]]_ if you have [[Rejuvenating Touch]].

An ally that recovers Hit Points from your _[[Lay on Hands]]_ gains 10 temporary Hit Points at the start of their turn during each of the next 10 rounds. This effect ends if the ally is knocked [[Unconscious]].
