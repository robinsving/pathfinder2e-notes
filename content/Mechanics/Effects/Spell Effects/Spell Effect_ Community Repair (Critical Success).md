# Spell Effect: Community Repair (Critical Success)
![[icons-commodities-tech-cog-brass.webp|150 lp right]]

**Critical Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction, and it takes on further qualities, encouraged by the thoughts of the community. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they receive a +1 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects and a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds.
