# Spell Effect: Ancestral Form
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ancestral-form.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Ancestral Form]]_

You take the form of your ancestral spirits, becoming [[Invisible]] and quasi-corporeal. You gain resistance 10 to all damage (except force and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), and this resistance is doubled against non-magical and precision damage.

You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed; when [[Fly|Flying]], moving upward isn't difficult terrain for you. You can't move through solid objects, but you can float through tiny gaps.

You can't Cast Spells (but you can [[Sustain|Sustain a Spell]]), activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increasse by 5.
