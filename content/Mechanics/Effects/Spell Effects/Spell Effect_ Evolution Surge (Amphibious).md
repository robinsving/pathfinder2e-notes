![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-evolution-surge.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Evolution Surge]]_

You flood your eidolon with power, creating a temporary evolution in your eidolon's capabilities. Choose one of the following effects:

*   Your eidolon can breathe underwater and gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Alternatively, if your eidolon is normally aquatic, it can breathe air and gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Either way, it gains the amphibious trait.
