Granted by _[[Evolution Surge]]_

You flood your eidolon with power, creating a temporary evolution in your eidolon's capabilities. Choose one of the following effects:

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** Add the options from the 3rd-level version and the following options to the list of effects you can choose:

*   Your eidolon becomes Huge, instead of its previous size. This increases your eidolon's reach to 15 feet but doesn't change any other statistics for your eidolon. Because of the special link you share, you can ride your eidolon without getting in each other's way. If another creature tries to ride your eidolon, both you and the riding creature each regain only 2 actions at the start of your turns each round, as normal.
