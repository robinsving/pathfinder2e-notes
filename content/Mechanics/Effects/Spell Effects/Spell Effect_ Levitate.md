# Spell Effect: Levitate
![[icons-magic-light-projectile-stars-blue.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Levitate]]_.

You take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls while floating in the air. You can spend an Interact action to stabilize yourself and negate this penalty for the remainder of the turn.
