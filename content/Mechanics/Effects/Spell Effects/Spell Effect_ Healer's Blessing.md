# Spell Effect: Healer's Blessing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-healers-blessing.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Healer's Blessing]]_

When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points. The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.
