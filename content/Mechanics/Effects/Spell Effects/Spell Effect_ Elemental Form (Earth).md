Granted by _[[Elemental Form]]_

You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. While in this form, you gain the earth trait and the elemental trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   10 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Strength based. If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:

*   **Earth**
    *   Speed 20 feet, burrow Speed 20 feet;
    *   **Melee** 1 fist, **Damage** 2d10 bludgeoning.
