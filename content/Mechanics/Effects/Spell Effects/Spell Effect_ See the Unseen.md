# Spell Effect: See the Unseen
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-see-invisibility.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[See the Unseen]]_

You can see invisible creatures as though they weren't invisible, although their features are blurred, making them [[Concealed]] and difficult to identify. You also gain a +2 status bonus to checks you make to disbelieve illusions.
