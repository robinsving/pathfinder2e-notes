You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. While in this form, you gain the fire trait and the elemental trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Dexterity based. If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
