# Spell Effect: Moon Frenzy
![[icons-creatures-mammals-humanoid-cat-skulking-teal.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Moon Frenzy]]_

Targets gain temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds, and weakness to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. If a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.
