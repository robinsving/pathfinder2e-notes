![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-elemental-gift.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Elemental Gift]]_

An elemental force fills your target, granting the target the swiftness of air, the ruggedness of earth, the sting of fire, or the flexibility of water, depending on which element you choose. Choose an element when you Cast the Spell. The target gains the benefit of that element as described below, and this spell gains that trait's element.

*   **Fire** The target's melee unarmed Strikes and melee weapon Strikes deal 1d6 persistent fire damage on a hit.
