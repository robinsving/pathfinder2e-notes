# Spell Effect: Flashy Disappearance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-flashy-disappearance.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Flashy Disappearance]]_

You create a puff of colorful smoke that quickly disperses while you become temporarily invisible. You become undetected to all creatures unless they can see invisible creatures. You Stride. At the end of your movement, if you have cover, greater cover, or concealment, attempt a Stealth check to Hide. You gain a +2 status bonus to this Stealth check. The invisibility then ends, and you either become observed or hidden to creatures as determined by your check to Hide, if you made one.
