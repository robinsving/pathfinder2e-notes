Granted by _[[Tempt Fate]]_.

The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw.

If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion.

**Heightened (8th)** The bonus on the saving throw is +2.
