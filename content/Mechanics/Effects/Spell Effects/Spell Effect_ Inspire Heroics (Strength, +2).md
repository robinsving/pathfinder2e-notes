# Spell Effect: Inspire Heroics (Strength, +2)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-inspire-heroics.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by succeeding on _[[Fortissimo Composition]]_ to enhance _[[Song of Strength]]_

You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +2 status bonus to Athletics checks and to their DCs against Athletics skill actions such as Disarm, Shove, and Trip.

_Note: bonus to DCs is not automatically added._
