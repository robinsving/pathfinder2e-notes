# Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Fiery Grasp)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-mantle-of-the-magma-heart.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Mantle of the Magma Heart]]_

You surround yourself in a mantle of blazing fire magic, and your skin and anything you're wearing morphs into burning hot lava. The air around you swelters with heat, and tiny sparks of flame dance behind you as you pass. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

*   **Fiery Grasp** Your hands swell and grow with lava. You gain a lava fist unarmed attack in the brawling weapon group. Your lava fists deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage as their base damage, plus an additional 2d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage.
