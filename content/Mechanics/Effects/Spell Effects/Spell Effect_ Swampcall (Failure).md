# Spell Effect: Swampcall (Failure)
![[icons-commodities-stone-stone-cratered-brown.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by _[[Swampcall]]_

You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Failure** The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes [[Off-Guard]]. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.
