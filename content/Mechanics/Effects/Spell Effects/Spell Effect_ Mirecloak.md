# Spell Effect: Mirecloak
![[icons-magic-water-ice-snowman.webp|150 lp right]]

You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.
