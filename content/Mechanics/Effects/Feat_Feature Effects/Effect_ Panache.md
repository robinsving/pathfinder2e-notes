# Effect: Panache
![[icons-commodities-treasure-crown-gold-laurel-wreath.webp|150 lp right]]

You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.
