# Stance: Disruptive Stance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-mastermind.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by: [[Disruptive Stance]]

The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions.

As long as you are in this stance, you can use [[Mechanics/Character Building/Actions/Reactive Strike]] when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions.

Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
