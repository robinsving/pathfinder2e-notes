# Stance: Impassable Wall Stance
![[icons-commodities-stone-paver-brick-brown.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by: [[Impassable Wall Stance]]

You refuse to let foes past your guard. As long as you are in this stance, when you critically hit with an [[Mechanics/Character Building/Actions/Reactive Strike]] triggered by a move action, you disrupt that move action.
