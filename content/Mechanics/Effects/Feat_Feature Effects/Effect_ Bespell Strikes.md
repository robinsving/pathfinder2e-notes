# Effect: Bespell Strikes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-astral-labyrinth.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Bespell Strikes]]

The weapon or unarmed attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage and gains the arcane trait if it didn't have it already. If the spell dealt a different type of damage, the Strike deals this type of damage instead.
