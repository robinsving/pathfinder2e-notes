# Effect: Disrupting Strikes
![[icons-weapons-swords-sword-flanged-lightning.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Disrupting Strikes]]

Your weapon and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a _disrupting_ property rune until the start of your next turn.

If you're 14th level or higher, your Strikes instead gain the effects of a _greater disrupting_ property rune.
