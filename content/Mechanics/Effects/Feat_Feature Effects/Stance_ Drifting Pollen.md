# Stance: Drifting Pollen
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-glow-maple-orange.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Drifting Pollen]]

A haze of pollen floats around you. A creature in your kinetic aura when you enter the stance, or who later enters the aura or ends its turn in the aura, attempts at a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, it's [[Sickened 1]] ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure) and [[Dazzled]] until it's no longer sickened. A creature attempts this save no more than once per round and doesn't attempt a new save if already affected.
