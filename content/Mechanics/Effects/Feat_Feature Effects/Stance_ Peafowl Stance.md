# Stance: Peafowl Stance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-storm-flash.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Peafowl Stance]]

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl.

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are melee Strikes with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword Strike, you can Step as a free action as your next action.
