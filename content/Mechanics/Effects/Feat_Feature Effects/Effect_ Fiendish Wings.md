# Effect: Fiendish Wings
![[icons-creatures-abilities-wing-batlike-purple-blue.webp|150 lp right]]

You can strain to call forth bat-like or otherwise fiendish wings from your back, similar in appearance to those of your fiendish ancestors. Once manifested, these wings remain for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while you've manifested your wings.
