# Effect: Elementalist Dedication
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-elemental-magic.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Elementalist Dedication]]

Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice: air, earth, fire, or water. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned elemental trait. This attunement lasts until you next make your daily preparations.
