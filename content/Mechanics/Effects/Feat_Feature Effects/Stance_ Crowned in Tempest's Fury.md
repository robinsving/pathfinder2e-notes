# Stance: Crowned in Tempest's Fury
![[icons-equipment-head-crown-horns-brown.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Crowned in Tempest's Fury]]

You become one with a devastating thunderstorm from the Plane of Air, placing a crown of lightning upon your brow. Sparks flash in your eyes, and lightning strikes constantly in the air around you as howling winds lift you from the ground.

*   Any creature that enters your kinetic aura or ends its turn there takes 2d12 electricity damage.
*   If you don't have a fly Speed, you gain a 20-foot fly Speed. If you have the Cyclonic Ascent impulse, you instead gain that fly Speed and the extra benefits.
*   You gain a +10-foot status bonus to all your Speeds.
*   Your air Elemental Blasts deal an additional 1d12 electricity damage.
