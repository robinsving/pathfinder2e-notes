![[icons-magic-nature-root-vine-beanstolk-green.webp|150 lp right]]

Select one unarmed attack you gained with Living Weapon. The damage die for that attack increases by one step until the end of your turn. In addition, choose to either have the attack gain a reach of 10 feet until the end of your turn or for you to gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with the chosen unarmed attack until the end of your turn.
