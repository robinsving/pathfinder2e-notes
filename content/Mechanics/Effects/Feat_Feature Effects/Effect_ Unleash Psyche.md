# Effect: Unleash Psyche
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-unleash-psyche.webp|150 lp right]]

When you cast a damaging spell, you gain a status bonus to its damage equal to double the spell's level. This applies only to spells that don't have a duration and that you cast using psychic spellcasting.
