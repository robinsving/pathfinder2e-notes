# Stance: Shooting Stars Stance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-shuriken.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Shooting Stars Stance]]

You enter a stance that lets you throw shuriken with lightning speed.

While in this stance, you can use your monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with shuriken instead.
