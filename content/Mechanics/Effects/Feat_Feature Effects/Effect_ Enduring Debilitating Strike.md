# Effect: Enduring Debilitating Strike
![[icons-skills-melee-strike-sword-blood-red.webp|150 lp right]]

The target has been affected by a rogue's [[Debilitating Strike]] if the rogue also has [[Enduring Debilitation]].

_Note: this effect only tracks the duration of the debilitation. You need to manually apply the specific penalties the rogue chose to apply._
