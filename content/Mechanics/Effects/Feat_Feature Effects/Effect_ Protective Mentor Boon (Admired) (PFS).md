# Effect: Protective Mentor Boon (Admired) (PFS)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-pfs-protective-mentor-boon.webp|150 lp right]]

**Effect** While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you shield your more fragile wards from the threat of death. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase their current and maximum Hit Points by an additional amount equal to 3 times your Radiant Oath reputation tier.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's Hit Points by 10% or 10, whichever is higher.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
