# Stance: Wolf Stance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-wolf-stance.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Wolf Stance]]

You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

If you're flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.
