# Stance: Gorilla Stance (Gorilla Pound)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-gorilla-stance.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Gorilla Stance]] if you have [[Gorilla Pound]], which grants you a climb speed of 15 while you are in this stance.

You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckle-walking stance. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Climb]], and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
