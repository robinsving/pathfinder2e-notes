# Effect: Emblazon Antimagic (Weapon)
![[icons-skills-melee-strike-sword-slashing-red.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Emblazon Antimagic]].

When the weapon's wielder critically hits with the weapon, they can attempt to counteract a spell on their target, using half their level, rounded up, as the counteract level. If they attempt to do so, the emblazoned symbol immediately disappears.
