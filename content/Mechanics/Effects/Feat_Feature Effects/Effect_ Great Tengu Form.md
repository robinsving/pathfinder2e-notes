# Effect: Great Tengu Form
![[icons-creatures-birds-corvid-call-sound-glowing.webp|150 lp right]]

Once per day, as part of using Long-Nosed Form, you also gain the benefits of 4th-level _[[Enlarge]]_and _[[Fly]]_.

This lasts for 5 minutes or until you shift out of your Long-Nosed Form, whichever happens first.
