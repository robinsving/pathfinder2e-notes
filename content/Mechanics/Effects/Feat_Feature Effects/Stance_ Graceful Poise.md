# Stance: Graceful Poise
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-dagger.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by: [[Graceful Poise]]

With the right positioning, your off-hand weapon can strike like a scorpion's stinger.

While you are in this stance, if you make your second Strike from [[Double Slice]] with an agile weapon, Double Slice counts as one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
