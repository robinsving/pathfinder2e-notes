# Effect: Masterful Hunter's Edge, Flurry
![[icons-skills-melee-strike-polearm-light-orange.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted when a ranger shares their [[Masterful Hunter (Flurry)]] with you.

Your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is -3 (-2 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn instead of -5, and -6 (-4 with an agile weapon) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn, instead of -10.
