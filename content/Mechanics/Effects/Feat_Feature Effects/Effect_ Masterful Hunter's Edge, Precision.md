# Effect: Masterful Hunter's Edge, Precision
![[icons-skills-ranged-target-bullseye-archer-orange.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted when a ranger shares their [[Masterful Hunter (Precision)]] with you.

The second time in a round you hit your hunted prey, you also deal 1d8 precision damage.

At 19th level, your second hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 2d8 precision damage, and your third hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 1d8 precision damage.
