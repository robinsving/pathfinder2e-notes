![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-lost-in-the-crowd.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Lost in the Crowd]]

You've learned how to move as one with crowds and hide among them, vanishing into a busy street in the blink of an eye. You move at full Speed in crowds and can use cover from crowds to Hide and Sneak, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus on your Stealth checks when in a crowd of at least 100 creatures.
