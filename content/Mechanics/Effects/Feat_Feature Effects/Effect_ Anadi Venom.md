# Effect: Anadi Venom
![[icons-skills-melee-blade-tip-energy-green.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Anadi Venom]]

If the next fangs Strike you make before the end of your turn hits and deals damage, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 poison damage. On a critical failure, the poison is wasted as normal. At 12th level, this poison damage increases to 2d6.
