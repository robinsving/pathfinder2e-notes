![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-sleep-arrow.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Multishot Stance]].

While you are in this stance, your penalty for Double Shot is reduced to -1, or -2 if you add the extra action to make three Strikes. If you move from your position, this stance ends.
