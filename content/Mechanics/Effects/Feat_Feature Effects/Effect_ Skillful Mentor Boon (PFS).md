![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-pfs-skillful-mentor-boon.webp|150 lp right]]

**Effect** While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide vital advice to sharpen your newer colleagues' skills. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to skill checks to 2.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's skill check modifiers by 1.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
