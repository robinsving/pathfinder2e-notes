# Effect: Favored Terrain (Gain Swim Speed)
![[icons-magic-water-wave-water-blue.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Favored Terrain|Favored Terrain (Aquatic)]] if you have the [[Unimpeded Journey|Wild Stride]] class feature, and are in aquatic terrain and do not already have a swim Speed.

You gain a swim Speed equal to your Speed.
