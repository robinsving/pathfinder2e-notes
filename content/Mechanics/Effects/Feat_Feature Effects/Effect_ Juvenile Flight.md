# Effect: Juvenile Flight
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-blue-glowing.webp|150 lp right]]

You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while your wings are unfurled.

If you have [[Fledgling Flight]], you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed with Juvenile Flight. As normal, since your fly Speed is derived from your land Speed, this status bonus isn't cumulative with a status bonus to your land Speed, if you have one.
