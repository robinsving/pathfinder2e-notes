# Stance: Mobile Shot Stance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-jump.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by: [[Mobile Shot Stance]]

Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

If you have [[Mechanics/Character Building/Actions/Reactive Strike]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
