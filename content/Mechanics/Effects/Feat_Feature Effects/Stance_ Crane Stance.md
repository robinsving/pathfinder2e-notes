# Stance: Crane Stance
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-damaged-brown.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Crane Stance]]

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]] by 5, and when you [[Leap]], you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
