# Effect: Overdrive
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-overdrive-critical-success.webp|150 lp right]]

Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.
