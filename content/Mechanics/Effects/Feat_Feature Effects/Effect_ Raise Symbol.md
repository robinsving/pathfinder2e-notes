# Effect: Raise Symbol
![[icons-magic-holy-barrier-shield-winged-cross.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Raise Symbol]]

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws until the start of your next turn. While it's raised, if you roll a success at a saving throw against a vitality or void effect, you get a critical success instead.
