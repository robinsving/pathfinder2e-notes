# Effect: Ancestral Influence
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chromatic-image.webp]]

One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll `dice: 1d4` on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll `dice: 1d4` and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.
