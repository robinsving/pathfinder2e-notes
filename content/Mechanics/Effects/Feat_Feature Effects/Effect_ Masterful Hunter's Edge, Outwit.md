Granted when a ranger shares their [[Masterful Hunter (Outwit)]] with you.

Your mastery of skills allows you to overwhelm your prey. If you have master proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or the skill you use to Recall Knowledge about your prey, increase the circumstance bonus against the prey with that skill from +2 to +4.

If you have master proficiency with your armor, increase the circumstance bonus to AC against the prey from +1 to +2.
