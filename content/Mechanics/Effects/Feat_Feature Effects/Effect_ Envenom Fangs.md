# Effect: Envenom Fangs
![[icons-creatures-abilities-fang-tooth-poison-green.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Envenom Fangs]]

You envenom your fangs. If the next fangs Strike you make before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 poison damage. On a critical failure, the poison is wasted as normal.
