# Stance: Cobra Stance (Cobra Envenom)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-cobra-stance.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Cobra Stance]] if you have [[Cobra Envenom]], which increases the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and Fortitude DC to +2.

You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks. These deal 1d4 poison damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, deadly d10, finesse, nonlethal, poison, and unarmed traits.

While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.
