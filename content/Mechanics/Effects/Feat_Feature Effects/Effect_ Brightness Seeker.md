# Effect: Brightness Seeker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-moonlight-bridge.webp|150 lp right]]

**Trigger** You attempt an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw while performing the course of action from your _[[Augury]]_, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

**Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus to the triggering check, or a +2 status bonus if the result of the augury was woe and you proceeded anyway.
