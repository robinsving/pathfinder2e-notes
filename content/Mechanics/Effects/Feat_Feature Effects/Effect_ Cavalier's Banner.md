Granted by [[Cavalier's Banner]]

You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising your allies' spirits. You and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves and DCs against fear effects. If your banner is destroyed or removed, allies within 30 feet become [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].
