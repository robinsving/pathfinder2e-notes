# Effect: Starlight Armor
![[icons-magic-light-explosion-star-glow-blue.webp|150 lp right]]

The armor grants you resistance 7 to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage. The armor also sheds bright light for 20 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet).

When you reach 17th level, the resistance increases to 10.
