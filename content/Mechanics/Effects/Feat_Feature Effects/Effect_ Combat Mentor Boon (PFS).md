# Effect: Combat Mentor Boon (PFS)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-pfs-combat-mentor-boon.webp|150 lp right]]

**Effect** While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide pointers and lead drills that ensure your newer colleagues' attacks strike true. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to attack rolls and spell attack rolls to 2.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's attack roll and spell attack roll modifiers by 1.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
