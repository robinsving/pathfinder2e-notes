# Effect: Bon Mot (Critical Success)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-feats-bon-mot.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by [[Bon Mot]]

You are distracted and takes a -3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute.

You can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.
