![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-spellguard-shield.webp|150 lp right]]

When in this stance, you wield the shield with both hands. When wielding a shield this way, increase the weapon damage die of the shield's boss or spikes by one step, and increase the shield's Hardness by 2 when using the [[Shield Block]] reaction.
