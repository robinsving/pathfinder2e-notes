![[icons-creatures-invertebrates-spider-web-black.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted when a ranger shares their [[Outwit]] edge with you.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks, Intimidation checks, Stealth checks, and any checks to Recall Knowledge about the prey, and a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against your prey's attacks.
