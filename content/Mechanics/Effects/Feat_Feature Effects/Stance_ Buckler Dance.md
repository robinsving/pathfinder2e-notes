# Stance: Buckler Dance
![[icons-equipment-shield-buckler-wooden-boss-brown.webp|150 lp right]]

Granted by: [[Buckler Dance]]

* * *

**Requirements** You are wielding a [[Buckler]].

* * *

You spin your buckler defensively toward every attack. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your buckler raised as if you'd used [[Raise a Shield]], as long as you meet that action's requirements.
