![[icons-magic-symbols-elements-air-earth-fire-water.webp|150 lp right]]

The Ghaele changes the elemental damage dealt by its greatsword and light ray to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

It can also change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a different type than for its attacks).
