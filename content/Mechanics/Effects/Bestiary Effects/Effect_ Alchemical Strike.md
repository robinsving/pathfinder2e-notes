# Effect: Alchemical Strike
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-bombs-redpitch-bomb.webp|150 lp right]]

Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage. The drudge imbues its fist attacks with this damage.

Each hit deals 1d6 points of damage of the same type as that of the bomb loaded into it. Each bomb has enough fluid in it for 10 successful strikes.
