# Effect: Harrow Burst
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-black.webp|150 lp right]]

A creature that fails its save rolls 1d6 to determine a suit of cards: 1 = hammers (Strength), 2 = keys (Dexterity), 3 = shields (Constitution), 4 = books (Intelligence), 5 = stars (Wisdom), 6 = crowns (Charisma). The creature takes a –1 status penalty to all checks related to that ability score for 1 round (–2 status penalty on a critical failure)
