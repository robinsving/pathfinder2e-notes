# Effect: PFS Level Bump
![[icons-magic-control-buff-strength-muscle-damage.webp|150 lp right]]

Scenarios and quests are designed to challenge PCs whose average level is the lower of the two levels in a given Level Range (i.e., Level Range 1–2 is built to challenge 1st-level PCs, and Level Range 3–4 is built to challenge 3rd-level PCs). Normally, when the Challenge Point total determines that the group's overall power is equivalent to the higher level in a Level Range (e.g. 2nd level in Level Range 1–2), the scenario's scaling will adjust for this.

However, sometimes it is necessary to add a level bump, such as when the scenario's scaling is based on the number of players, or if the scenario lacks a low tier 16-18 scaling.

*   Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and ACs by 1.
*   Increase the Hit Point total by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.
