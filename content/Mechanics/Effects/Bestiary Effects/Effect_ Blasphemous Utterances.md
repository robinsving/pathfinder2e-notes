# Effect: Blasphemous Utterances
![[icons-creatures-magical-spirit-poison-smoke-green.webp|150 lp right]]

The creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects.

It can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless it succeeds at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
