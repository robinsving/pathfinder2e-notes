# Effect: Remove Face
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-skinsaw-mask.webp|150 lp right]]

The creature takes a permanent -4 status penalty to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. This penalty can be removed only if the victim recovers its face and has a _[[Restoration]]_ spell cast on it.
