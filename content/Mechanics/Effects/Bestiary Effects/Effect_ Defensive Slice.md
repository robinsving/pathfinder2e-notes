# Effect: Defensive Slice
![[icons-skills-melee-hand-grip-sword-red.webp|150 lp right]]

Baron Drelev assumes a defensive position with his weapons out, then attempts a melee Strike. He takes a -2 status penalty on all Strikes (including this one) and gains a +2 status bonus to his AC until the start of his next turn.
