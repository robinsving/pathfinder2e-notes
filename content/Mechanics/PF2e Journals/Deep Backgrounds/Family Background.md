# Family Background
The word family means something different to everyone. You might have a biological family, adopted family, step- family, or any other kind and combination you choose; family bonds come in all types.

To determine the number of family members you grew up with as an active part of your life, roll 1d% on [[Family Size|this table]]. Use the medium family for most ancestries, small if you're a half-elf or half-orc, and large if you're a goblin or halfling. For ancestries other than those in the Core Rulebook, use the column that best suits the ancestry. It's up to you whether these family members are parents, siblings, grandparents, or other close relatives.

*   If you grew up with no family, you had to learn to survive on your own. Add a Strength ability boost and a Constitution ability boost to your options.
    
*   If you grew up with one or two family members, your closeness to them made you highly aware of their feelings, and you. Add an Intelligence ability boost and a Wisdom ability boost to your options.
    
*   If you grew up with three or more family members, you had to mediate family conflicts and negotiate a crowded home. Add a Charisma ability boost and a Dexterity ability boost to your options.
