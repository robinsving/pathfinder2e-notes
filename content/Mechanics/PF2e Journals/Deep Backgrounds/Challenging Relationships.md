# Challenging Relationships
Roll on [[Challenging Relationship|this table]] to generate a challenging connection.

## Accidental Fall

This character once inadvertently shoved you off a ledge or balcony. You're mostly certain it was a mistake, but the fall was terrifying, and you've resolved to never be caught unaware like that again.

Add the [[Cat Fall]] skill feat to your background options.

## Accusation of Theft

You were once secretly certain that this character stole a cherished valuable from you. You were determined to steal it back, until you learned that this character wasn't in fact to blame and you'd only misplaced the item.

Add the [[Pickpocket]] skill feat to your background options.

## Called Before Judges

Information provided by this character-either intentionally or inadvertently given-required you to justify yourself in front of a group of bureaucrats or magistrates.

Add the [[Group Impression]] skill feat to your background options.

You have long considered this character your rival in a question of strength. You are determined to prove yourself to be mightier, perhaps by intelligent application of force if you aren't physically imposing.

Add the [[Hefty Hauler]] skill feat to your background options.

Add the [[Impressive Performance]] skill feat to your background options.

## Slander

You and this character were rivals for the same person's affections, and you stooped to spreading vicious lies before the whole situation fell apart.
