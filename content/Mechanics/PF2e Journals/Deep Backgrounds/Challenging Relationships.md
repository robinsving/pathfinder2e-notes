# Challenging Relationships
Roll on [[Challenging Relationship|this table]] to generate a challenging connection.

## Accidental Fall

This character once inadvertently shoved you off a ledge or balcony. You're mostly certain it was a mistake, but the fall was terrifying, and you've resolved to never be caught unaware like that again.

Add the [[Cat Fall]] skill feat to your background options.

## Accusation of Theft

You were once secretly certain that this character stole a cherished valuable from you. You were determined to steal it back, until you learned that this character wasn't in fact to blame and you'd only misplaced the item.

Add the [[Pickpocket]] skill feat to your background options.

## Called Before Judges

Information provided by this character-either intentionally or inadvertently given-required you to justify yourself in front of a group of bureaucrats or magistrates.

Add the [[Group Impression]] skill feat to your background options.

## Matter of Might

You have long considered this character your rival in a question of strength. You are determined to prove yourself to be mightier, perhaps by intelligent application of force if you aren't physically imposing.

Add the [[Hefty Hauler]] skill feat to your background options.

## Mercantile Expertise

To encourage an employer to hire you instead of this character, you worked hard to demonstrate your keen mercantile sense. It didn't work; the employer hired this character anyway.

You and this character worked for a time as rival hunters, whether tracking animals or escaped criminals.

Add the [[Experienced Tracker]] skill feat to your background options.

## Seeking Accolades

You never seemed to capture the attention of the crowds at the tavern as easily as this character did, so you worked hard to practice your showmanship.

Add the [[Impressive Performance]] skill feat to your background options.

## Slander

You and this character were rivals for the same person's affections, and you stooped to spreading vicious lies before the whole situation fell apart.

Add the [[Charming Liar]] skill feat to your background options.

## Social Maneuvering

You have always wanted to prove yourself better than this character in a fancy social situation but have yet to decisively do so.

Add the [[Courtly Graces]] skill feat to your background options.
