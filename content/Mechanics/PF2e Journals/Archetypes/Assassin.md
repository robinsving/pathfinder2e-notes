# Assassin
Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Poison Resistance]]; 6th [[Poison Weapon]], [[Sneak Attacker]]; 10th [[Improved Poison Weapon]]

## [[Assassin Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Alchemical Crafting; trained in Crafting, Deception, and Stealth

* * *

You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision. You gain the [[Mark for Death]] activity.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the assassin archetype.

## [[Angel of Vindication]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

**Requirements** Your mark is an undead creature.

* * *

To aid with your mission of destroying undead, you've specialized in techniques to destroy them, much as other assassins learn to kill the living. When you Strike an off-guard undead foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 3 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 6 extra precision damage instead of 2. If you have the Angel of Death feat, your attacks also instantly destroy undead at 0 Hit Points, and attempts for the undead to rejuvenate—such as via a lich's soul cage or a ghost's rejuvenation ability—fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or deity. Finally, if you have the Assassinate feat and an undead mark critically fails its save against your Assassinate, it is destroyed.

## [[Eclipsed Vitality]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication, or Scout Dedication; master in Stealth

**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

* * *

You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when Avoiding Notice, Hiding, and Sneaking to foil lifesense, and you're concealed to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.

## [[Expert Backstabber]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

* * *

When you Strike an off-guard foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 2 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 4 extra precision damage instead of 2.

## [[Surprise Attack]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

* * *

You act before foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are off-guard to you.

## [[Public Execution]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.

**Requirements** You have designated a mark using Mark for Death.

* * *

Some rebel Firebrand cells make a practice of publicly declaring the main target of a given operation. You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.

## [[Angel Of Death]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

* * *

All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity.

## [[Assassinate]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication

**Requirements** You have designated a mark using Mark for Assassination and are completely unnoticed by your mark.

* * *

You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes 6d6 extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an incapacitation effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.
