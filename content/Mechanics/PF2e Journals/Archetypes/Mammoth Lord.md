# Mammoth Lord
The Kellid people of the far north are collectively known as the Mammoth Lords, but this name is something of a generalization. True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north.

You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Animal Empathy (Ranger)]], [[Quick Mount]]; 6th [[Companion's Cry]]; 12th [[Trampling Charge]]; 20th [[Legendary Rider]]

#### What Counts as Megafauna?

The megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are. Large dinosaurs like the stegosaurus and triceratops qualify as megafauna, for example, but smaller dinosaurs like raptors don't. A list of well-established megafauna can be found below, but it isn't an exclusive list; other, more unusual, species might be permitted with GM approval. One rule is certain, however: an adult megafauna is always Large or bigger.

Cave Bear: Use a bear's statistics for a cave bear animal companion.

Daeodon: Use a boar's statistics for a daeodon, or giant boar, companion.

Dire Wolf: Use a wolf's statistics for a dire wolf companion.

Mammoth: Use a elephant's statistics for the statistics for an elephant or woolly mammoth animal companion.

Roc: Use bird statistics for a young roc.

Smilodon: Use cat statistics for a smilodon animal companion.

Triceratops: Use triceratops statistics for a triceratops or other armored dinosaur, such as a stegosaurus or ankylosaurus.

Tyrannosaurus: Use tyrannosaurus statistics for for a tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, or similar dinosaur.

Woolly Rhinoceros: Use rhinoceros statistics for a rhinoceros or woolly rhinoceros animal companion.

**MAMMOTH LORD ANIMAL COMPANIONS**

If you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the basic rules for animal companions. As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain [[Call Companion]] to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source.

## [[Mammoth Lord Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Ride

* * *

You've undertaken the ultimate challenge of the Mammoth Lords and tamed a megafauna. You gain a megafauna you tamed as a young animal companion. Your megafauna animal companion must be a megafauna appropriate to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords;. While an animal companion usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).

Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can give you a second animal companion. If you have more than one animal companion, you can adventure with only one of them at a time. You can switch between them like a beastmaster does. You gain the [[Call Companion]] action, as the beastmaster archetype, and you follow all the other rules found in the Call Companion sidebar; see [[Beastmaster Dedication]] for details on this action and the rules for multiple companions.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from this archetype.

## [[Mammoth Charge]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

**Requirements** You are riding your megafauna companion.

* * *

You [[Command an Animal]] to order your megafauna companion to Stride twice. At any point during this movement, you can make a melee Strike against one enemy within reach.

## [[Mature Megafauna Companion]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

* * *

You've raised your megafauna companion to be a more powerful force on the battlefield than most of its kind. The companion you gained through the Mammoth Lord Dedication feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your megafauna animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.

## [[Megafauna Veterinarian]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication; expert in Nature

* * *

By heeding the wise advice of elders in your following- and aided by your own experience-you've learned how to provide medical care to the megafauna of the Mammoth Lord followings. You can attempt a Nature check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicine's trained and untrained uses, provided the subject of your medical care is a megafauna. If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as [[Treat Wounds]]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.

## [[Speech of the Mammoth Lords]] Feat 7

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication; master in Diplomacy or Intimidation

* * *

You've learned the ancient tongue spoken by the creatures of the far north. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, use the Diplomacy skill with, and [[Coerce]] megafauna. In most cases, megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords will hear you out.

## [[Incredible Megafauna Companion]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Mature Megafauna Companion

* * *

Under your care and training, your megafauna companion has realized its innate potential. Your companion becomes an indomitable or savage animal companion (your choice), gaining additional abilities determined by the type of companion.

## [[Staggering Blow]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

**Requirements** You're riding a megafauna companion that has a melee Strike.

* * *

You've trained your megafauna companion to stagger its enemies, impeding their ability to fight back. You [[Command an Animal]] to order your megafauna companion to spend both its actions making a single, powerful Strike. The attack deals an extra die of weapon damage, and if the attack hits and deals damage, the target is [[Slowed]] until the end of its next turn.

## [[Unbreakable Bond]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

* * *

You and your megafauna companion are bound together; as long as you live, it's much harder for your companion to die. If your megafauna companion gains the dying condition, it automatically succeeds at the recovery check to stabilize at 0 Hit Points on its turn. Additionally, your megafauna companion only dies at dying 5 rather than dying 4. Finally, the first time each day your megafauna companion would reach dying 5 and die, as long as you're still alive, your companion's dying value decreases to 0 instead.

## [[Gigantic Megafauna Companion]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

* * *

The mammoths and other megafauna ridden by your people are larger than any ordinary beast. Your megafauna companion increases in size to Huge but doesn't otherwise change its statistics.

## [[Specialized Megafauna Companion]] Feat 14

**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication

* * *

You've trained your mammoth or other megafauna companion to perform in unusual or extreme situations, granting it abilities far beyond others of its kind. Your megafauna gains your choice of the bully, racer, tracker, or wrecker specialization.

**Special** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time, add a different specialization of the ones listed above to your megafauna companion. Your megafauna can't have more than three specializations.
