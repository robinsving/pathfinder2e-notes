# Ritualist
While some learn the art of ritual casting through rigorous study, other gifted individuals may find that a combination of natural talent and luck gives them surprising skill at performing rituals, whether they want that power or not.

## [[Ritualist Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion

* * *

You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to perform a ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals with a level no higher than half your level; you must meet all prerequisites for casting the ritual to choose it. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual with a level no higher than half your level and for which you meet the prerequisites. You can cast these as the primary caster, but you can't teach them to anyone else or allow someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Ritualist archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it.

## [[Flexible Ritualist]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Ritualist Dedication

* * *

You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that secondary caster. You can't replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as in the atone ritual).

## [[Resourceful Ritualist]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Ritualist Dedication

* * *

You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary proficiency if you are a master.

## [[Efficient Rituals]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Ritualist Dedication

* * *

You can perform some rituals in less time. If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half the number of days, rounded up.

## [[Assured Ritualist]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Flexible Ritualist

* * *

You can cover for a secondary caster's error. If you are the primary caster, after rolling all the secondary checks, choose one check on which the secondary caster rolled a failure or critical failure, and treat the result as one degree of success better.

## [[Speedy Rituals]] Feat 14

**Prerequisites** Efficient Rituals

* * *

You can perform rituals in only a fraction of the usual time. If a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.
