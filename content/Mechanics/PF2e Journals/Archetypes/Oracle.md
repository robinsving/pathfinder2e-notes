# Oracle
A mysterious force granted you divine magic and a curse.

## [[Oracle Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Charisma 14

* * *

Choose a mystery. You become trained in Religion and the mystery's skill; if you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the mild, constant effects of the mystery's curse described in its first paragraph, but not other effects the mystery usually grants. You cast spells like an oracle and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two cantrips, either common divine cantrips or other divine cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in divine spell attack rolls and divine spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for oracle archetype spells is Charisma, and they are divine oracle spells.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oracle archetype.

## [[Basic Mysteries]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Oracle Dedication

* * *

You gain a 1st- or 2nd-level oracle feat of your choice.

## [[Basic Oracle Spellcasting]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Oracle Dedication

## [[First Revelation]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Oracle Dedication

You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell. Casting this spell progresses your curse. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become off-guard in addition to the effects of the minor curse.

If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.

## [[Advanced Mysteries]] Feat 6
