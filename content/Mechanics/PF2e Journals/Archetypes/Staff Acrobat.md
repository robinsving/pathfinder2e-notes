# Staff Acrobat
You can perform amazing acts in and out of combat when you have a spear, staff, or polearm.

## [[Staff Acrobat Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Dexterity 16; trained in Acrobatics; trained in Athletics; trained with at least one of the following weapons: staff, bo staff, halfling sling staff, or any weapon in the spear or polearm group (referred to in this archetype as 'your staff')

* * *

When you High Jump, Leap, or Long Jump while wielding your staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any Athletics check required and add 5 feet to the distance you can Leap vertically and horizontally. You can Shove and Trip even if you don't have a free hand, provided you are wielding your staff. Finally, when you roll a success on a check to Balance while wielding your staff, you get a critical success instead.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the staff acrobat archetype.

## [[Bullying Staff]] Feat 4
