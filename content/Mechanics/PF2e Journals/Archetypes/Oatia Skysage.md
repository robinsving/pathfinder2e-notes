# Oatia Skysage
The tradition of Oatia skysages stems from a small sect of dedicated stargazers on Castrovel. To better study the celestial mantle, these eccentric astronomers broke away from their Sovyrian kin and migrated to the wild continent of Ukulam, where the night skies were clear of light pollution. Though reclusive, Oatia skysages have been known to pass on their esoteric knowledge and unique worldview to similar-minded adventurers. Such adventuring skysages search for secrets and omens in the stars and can even call down stars' light to aid them in battle.

## [[Oatia Skysage Dedication]] Feat 2

Your study of the stars unlocks supernatural insights and magic. You either become trained in Astronomy Lore or an expert in Occultism.

You learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips of your choice; these cantrips can be from any spell tradition, but they must be divination spells. You cast these spells as occult spells as you draw on the stars and night sky. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free and you've gazed at the night sky in the last 24 hours, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Oatia skysage archetype.

## [[Basic Skysage Divination]] Feat 4

The stars move, granting you a sliver of their magic. Choose a 1st-level spell from any spell list to add to your spell repertoire. You can Cast this Spell as an occult Oatia skysage spell.

At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level spell. Each of these spells must be from the divination school.

## [[Stargazer's Eyes]] Feat 4

Long hours in darkened observatories have sharpened your senses. If you don't have low-light vision or darkvision, you gain low-light vision, or if you already have low-light vision, you gain darkvision.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, upgrading your low-light vision to darkvision.

## [[Night's Glow]] Feat 6

The stars and moon lend you their light. You gain your choice of the _[[Moonbeam]]_ or _[[Zenith Star]]_ domain spell. Like your Oatia skysage spells, you cast this focus spell as an occult spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover by using the Refocus to reflect upon or gaze at the stars.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.

## [[Minor Omen]] Feat 8

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a Reflex save.

**Requirements** You can see the night sky.

* * *

The stars warn you of danger in the nick of time. Reroll the failed save and use the new result.

## [[Scholar's Hunch]] Feat 8

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a Lore or Occultism skill check.

* * *

Scholarly debates have taught you to think on your feet. Reroll the failed check and use the new result.

## [[Starlit Spells]] Feat 10

The stars reveal and punish your enemies. You can cast _[[Faerie Fire]]_ and 3rd-level _[[Holy Light]]_ as occult innate spells, each once per day.

## [[Expert Skysage Divination]] Feat 10

Your studies of the stars have taught you about the mysteries of the cosmos. You learn a 4th-level spell from any spell list. At 12th level, you learn a 5th-level spell, and at 14th level, you learn a 6th-level spell. Each of these spells must come from the divination school. You become an expert with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.

## [[Night's Shine]] Feat 12

Your power from the moon and stars becomes strong enough to illuminate the night sky. You gain your choice of the _[[Asterism]]_ or _[[Touch of the Moon]]_ domain spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.

## [[Night's Warning]] Feat 14

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** You can see the night sky.

* * *

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your Occultism DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn't take the –2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.

## [[Starlight Armor]] Feat 14

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You armor yourself in the light of distant suns, shielding yourself from harm. The armor grants you resistance 7 to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage. The armor also sheds bright light for 20 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet).

Whenever an adjacent creature attacks you, the attacker must attempt a @Check\[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)\] save against your spell DC at the end of its action. On a failure, it becomes [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn. Regardless of the result of the save, the attacker is temporarily immune until the end of its next turn. The dazzling effect has the light and visual traits.

When you reach 17th level, the resistance increases to 10.

## [[Master Skysage Divination]] Feat 16

You unlock the most powerful secrets hidden in the stars above. You learn a 7th-level spell from any spell list. At 18th level, you learn an 8th-level spell, and at 20th level, you learn a 9th-level spell. Each of these spells must come from the divination school. You gain master proficiency with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
