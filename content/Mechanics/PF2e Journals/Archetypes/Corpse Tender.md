# Corpse Tender
You tend to mindless undead, such as the zombie farmhands and farm animals throughout Geb.

## [[Corpse Tender Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** evil alignment, trained in Religion

* * *

You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[Request|Requests]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely hostile toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.

You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the corpse tender archetype.

## [[Command Corpse]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Corpse Tender Dedication, ability to cast _[[Harm]]_

* * *

You gain the [[Command Undead]] feat, but you can use it only to transform the effects of _[[Harm]]_ spells you cast on mindless undead. These spells can control creatures with a level equal to or lower than your level -1 (instead of your level - 3).

## [[Corpse Tender's Font]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Corpse Tender Dedication

* * *

You easily tend to the wounds of the dead. You can cast _[[Harm]]_ as a divine innate spell once per day. This spell is heightened to half your level, rounded up. You can target only mindless undead with this spell.

## [[Improved Command Corpse]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Command Corpse

* * *

When you use [[Command Undead]] on a mindless undead, if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it becomes your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it becomes your minion for 1 hour. If it critically fails, it becomes your minion for 24 hours.

## [[Imbue Mindlessness]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Command Corpse

* * *

You grasp the mind of an undead creature and temporarily wipe it as empty as a zombie's brain. You can target any undead with your divine innate _[[Harm]]_ spell, not just mindless undead. When you target one non-mindless undead creature with this spell, you can transform its effects. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute. While it is stupefied, you can use your Corpse Tender feats on the target as though it were mindless.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] for 10 minutes.
