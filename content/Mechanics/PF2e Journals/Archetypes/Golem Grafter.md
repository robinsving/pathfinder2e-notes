# Golem Grafter
You have replaced a portion of your body with artifice of the kind used to create golems, fortifying your flesh with the unyielding might of magical constructs.

## [[Golem Grafter Dedication]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** expert in Arcana and Crafting, or an ally with expert proficiency in those skills willing to augment you

* * *

Your flesh has been specially treated with the same arcane and alchemical processes used to toughen the skin of flesh golems. Increase your maximum Hit Points by an amount equal to your level. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to your number of class feats from the golem grafter archetype.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the golem grafter archetype.

## [[Accursed Clay Fist]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Golem Grafter Dedication, expert in unarmed attacks

* * *

You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed Strike with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against curse effects for 1 hour.

**Special** The damage die for your clay fist is 1d8, and it loses the agile and finesse traits of a typical fist.

## [[Quicken Heartbeat]] Feat 10

**Frequency** once per turn

**Prerequisites** Golem Grafter Dedication

* * *

You've replaced your heart with one made of animated quicksilver and living adamantine. You reduce your slowed condition by 1. Alternatively, if you are not slowed, you are quickened 1 during your next turn, and can use your extra action to Stride or Strike.

## [[Legs of Stone]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Golem Grafter Dedication

* * *

You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove or Trip you. You can Shove creatures even if you don't have a hand free. When you successfully Shove a foe, you can Stride away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.

## [[Iron Lung]] Feat 14

**Prerequisites** Golem Grafter Dedication

* * *

Your lungs are infused with the resilience of iron. Treat the result of your save against an inhaled poison as one degree of success better than you rolled. Additionally, you gain the following ability.

### [[Exhale Poison]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** You were within the area of an inhaled poison within the last minute

* * *

You sharply exhale the poison that previously surrounded you in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area are affected by the poison; the poison's DC and effects are unchanged.
