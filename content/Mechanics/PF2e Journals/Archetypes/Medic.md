# Medic
You've studied countless techniques for providing medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer.

## [[Medic Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Medicine, Battle Medicine

* * *

You become an expert in Medicine. When you succeed with Battle Medicine or Treat Wounds, the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in Medicine, you can do so once per hour.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Medic archetype.

## [[Doctor's Visitation]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication

* * *

You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. Stride, then use one of the following: Battle Medicine or Treat Poison. You can spend a second action to instead Stride and then Administer First Aid or Treat a Condition (if you have it; see below).

## [[Treat Condition]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication

**Requirements** You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.

* * *

You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.

* * *

**Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.

**Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.

**Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.

## [[Holistic Care]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition

* * *

You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add frightened, stupefied, and stunned to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it.

## [[Resuscitate]] Feat 16

**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication, legendary in Medicine

**Requirements** You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target's body is mostly intact.

* * *

You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
