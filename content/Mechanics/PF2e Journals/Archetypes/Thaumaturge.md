# Thaumaturge
Scraps of knowledge have taught you how to exploit the vulnerabilities of creatures and the powers of mystical objects.

## [[Thaumaturge Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Charisma 14

* * *

You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use esoterica actions. You become trained in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Glimpse Vulnerability]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the thaumaturge archetype.

## [[Basic Thaumaturgy]] Feat 4

You gain a 1st- or 2nd-level thaumaturge feat of your choice.

You gain one thaumaturge feat. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your thaumaturge level is equal to half your character level.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain another thaumaturge feat.

## [[Implement Initiate]] Feat 6
