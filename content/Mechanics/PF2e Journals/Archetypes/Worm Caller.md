# Worm Caller
You follow the ancient hryngar tradition of the worm callerâ€”mystics who can call upon the strength and destructive force of the mighty cave worms that inhabit the Darklands. You can manifest worms to attack your enemies, draw upon their senses and resistances, summon one to do your bidding and, eventually, become a worm yourself

## [[Worm Caller Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Trained in Nature or Cave Worm Lore

* * *

You pledge yourself to understanding and emulating one of the most powerful creatures of the Darklands: the mighty cave worm. You gain the [[Shake It Off]] reaction.

## [[Worm Sense]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

You emulate the senses of the cave worm. You gain darkvision and tremorsense as an imprecise sense within 5 feet.

The range of the tremorsense increases to 10 feet at 8th level and to 15 feet at 12th level.

## [[Wormskin]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

Your flesh grows thick and bloated, protecting you against harm. You gain resistance equal to half your level versus one of the following types of damage, chosen when you take the feat: fire, cold, or bludgeoning. This choice cannot be changed.

When you're unarmored, your flesh gives you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. You can apply with armor potency runes and property runes directly to your flesh, though excruciatingly painful.

**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, each time selecting a new damage type from the list.

## [[Inexorable]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

You imbue yourself with the resilience of the cave worm. When you gain the [[Paralyzed]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] condition, roll a @Check\[type:flat|dc:15\]. On a success you ignore the condition.

When using Worm Form you are immune to penalties to your Speed and the [[Immobilized]] condition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you, and you ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.

## [[Worm's Feast]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth a brood of infantile cave worms to feast on your enemy's flesh. Choose a creature within 30 feet; the creature must attempt a fortitude save. At 8th level and every 2 levels above that, the persistent piercing damage taken on a failure increases by 1d6.

* * *

**Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly.

**Success** The target takes `dice: 2d6` piercing damage and `dice: 2d6` persistent,piercing damage.

**Failure** The target takes `dice: 6d6` piercing damage and `dice: 2d6` persistent,piercing damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the target is [[Off-Guard]] as long as it takes persistent piercing damage.

## [[Worm Empathy]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

You can connect with cave worms (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple Requests of them. In most cases, the cave worm's starting attitude is indifferent and they will give you time to establish contact.

## [[Azure Fins]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

When submerged in water or another liquid, you form small fin-like arms along your body, granting you far greater maneuverability while swimming. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. Furthermore, while swimming on the surface of a liquid, you can [[Leap]] out of the liquid and do not fall until the end of your turn, allowing you to spend the rest of the turn above the surface.

## [[Call Worm Spirit]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth a ghostly manifestation of the worm spirit. Choose an intersection on the ground within 60 feet; the ghostly maw of a worm emerges from the ground, attacking all creatures in a 10 foot burst. Each creature in the area must attempt a reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes `dice: 1d10+13` bludgeoning damage as it is battered by the worm's body.

**Failure** The target takes `dice: 3d10+15` piercing damage as it is bitten by the worm. The target is [[Immobilized]] until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the damage increases to `dice: 6d10+30` bludgeoning and the target is knocked [[Prone]].

## [[Tunnel]] Feat 2

* * *

You gain a burrow speed of 10 feet.

## [[Crimson Breath]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

* * *

You gain a fire breath weapon similar to that of a crimson worm. You breathe a blast of flame in a @Template\[type:cone|distance:30\] that deals 12d6 fire damage to all creatures in the area (basic Reflex save). This damage increases by 2d6 at 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

## [[Venomous Touch]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication

You've learned to channel the sting of the worm. You gain _[[Purple Worm Sting]]_ as an innate primal spell that you can cast once per day.

You take on the form of a purple worm or transform into a humanoid-worm hybrid, retaining your own head but with a worm's body, transforming into a Huge battle form.

If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:
