# Flexible Spellcaster (Class Archetype)
You've learned how to cast spells flexibly, blending the best elements of spontaneous and prepared spellcasting at the cost of casting fewer spells each day.

#### Restricted Spell Slots

When applying this archetype to a class that grants additional spell slots with restrictions, such as the specialist wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font, you still gain those additional slots, but they work as normal for your class, and they don't add more spells to your spell collection. A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast _heal_ spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add _heal_ to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the _harm_ spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.
