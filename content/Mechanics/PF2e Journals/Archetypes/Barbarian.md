# Barbarian
There's a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.

## [[Barbarian Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Strength 14; Constitution 14

* * *

You become trained in Athletics; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC. You can use the [[Rage]] action. Choose an [[Instinct]] as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.

## [[Barbarian Resiliency]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Barbarian Dedication; class granting no more Hit Points per level than 10 + your Constitution modifier

* * *

You gain 3 additional Hit Points for each barbarian archetype class feat you have. As you continue selecting barbarian archetype class feats, you continue to gain additional Hit Points in this way.

## [[Basic Fury]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Barbarian Dedication

* * *

You gain a 1st- or 2nd-level barbarian feat.

## [[Advanced Fury]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Basic Fury

* * *

You gain one barbarian feat. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your barbarian level is equal to half your character level.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain another barbarian feat.

## [[Instinct Ability]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Barbarian Dedication

* * *

You gain the instinct ability for the instinct you chose for Barbarian Dedication.
