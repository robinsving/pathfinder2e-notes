# Lifestyle Expenses
# Cost of Living

For short periods of downtime, characters are usually just passing through a settlement or spending a bit of time there. They can use the prices for inn stays and meals found in [[Basic Services]]. For long stretches of downtime, use the values on the table below. Deduct these costs from a character's funds after they gain any money from their other downtime activities.

| **Standard of Living** | **Week** | **Month** | **Year** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subsistence\* | 4 sp | 2 gp | 24 gp |
| Comfortable | 1 gp | 4 gp | 52 gp |
| Fine | 30 gp | 130 gp | 1,600 gp |
| Extravagant | 100 gp | 430 gp | 5,200 gp |
| \* You can attempt to Subsist using Society or Survival for free. |  |  |  |

A character can live off the land instead, but each day they do, they typically use the [[Subsist]] activity to the exclusion of any other downtime activity.
