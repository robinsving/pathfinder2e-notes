# High-Quality Items
In this variant, gear can provide bonuses even if it's not magical. This is useful for games and settings that set out to give fine, non-magical items the same prominence as magic items. High-quality gear requires the corresponding proficiency rank in Crafting to Craft.

### High-Quality Weapons and Armor

High-quality weapons and armor give the same benefits as weapon and armor potency runes (Tables High-Quality Weapons & High-Quality Armor). To remove magic from weapons and armor, you can use the devastating attacks and saving throw potency entries from the automatic bonus progression variant, or you can have quality also provide the effects of striking and resilient runes, using Table: Devastating Weapons and Table Resilient Armor. If you choose to still have magic weapons and armor, the effects don't stack with quality.

### High-Quality Skill Items

Items with skill or Perception bonuses don't have fundamental runes. If an existing skill bonus item costs less than the listed Price for a high-quality skill item or has a lower level, it likely has a feature such as a limitation, so adjust accordingly. A character in a game with this variant can Craft or buy a non-magical item to boost Perception or a skill using the table below.
