# Animals & Barding
## Animals

The Prices for animals are listed both for renting and for purchasing them outright. You usually need to pay for animal rentals up front, and if the vendor believes the animal might be put in danger, they typically require a deposit equal to the purchase Price. Most animals panic in battle. When combat begins, they become frightened 4 and fleeing as long as they're frightened. If you successfully Command your Animal using Nature, you can keep it from fleeing, though this doesn't remove its frightened condition. If the animal is attacked or damaged, it returns to frightened 4 and fleeing, with the same exceptions.

Warhorses and warponies are combat trained. They don't become frightened or fleeing during encounters in this way.

| Guard Dog | 1 cp per day | 2 sp |

| Riding Horse | 1 sp per day | 8 gp |
| Warhorse | 1 gp per day | 30 gp (level 2) |
| Pony |  |  |
| Riding Pony | 8 cp per day | 7 gp |
| Warpony | 8 sp per day | 24 gp (level 2) |

## Barding

You can purchase special armor for animals, called barding. All animals have a trained proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the same rules as armor except for the following. The Price and Bulk of barding depend on the animal's size. Unlike for a suit of armor, barding's Strength entry is listed as a modifier, not a score. Barding can't be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.

| **Barding** | **Size** | **Price** | **AC Bonus** | **Dex Cap** | **Check Penalty** | **Speed Penalty** | **Bulk** | **Strength** |
