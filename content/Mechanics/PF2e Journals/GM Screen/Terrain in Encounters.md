# Terrain in Encounters
|  | **TERRAIN IN ENCOUNTERS** |
| --- | --- |
| **Difficult Terrain** | Each square costs 5 extra feet of movement |
| **Greater Difficult Terrain** | Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement |
| **Hazardous Terrain** | Moving through terrain deals damage. |
| **Narrow Surface** | [[Off-Guard]] and must [[Balance]] to cross. When you're hit or fail a save, succeed at a Reflex save or fall. |
| **Uneven Ground** | [[Off-Guard]] and might need to [[Balance]] or fall prone. When you're hit or fail a save, succeed at a Reflex save or fall. |
| **Incline** | You need to [[Climb]] to ascend an incline. You're [[Off-Guard]] while Climbing. |

# Terrain

Several types of terrain can complicate your movement by slowing you down, damaging you, or endangering you.

## Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. You can't [[Step]] into difficult terrain.

Movement you make while you are jumping ignores the terrain you're jumping over. Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let you ignore difficult terrain on foot; such an ability also allows you to move through greater difficult terrain at the normal movement cost as for difficult terrain, though it wouldn't let you ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.

## Hazardous Terrain

Hazardous terrain damages you whenever you move through it. An acid pool and a pit of burning embers are both examples of hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.

## Narrow Surfaces

A narrow surface is so precariously thin that you need to [[Balance]] (see Acrobatics) or risk falling. Even on a success, you are [[Off-Guard]] on a narrow surface. Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on a narrow surface, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the Acrobatics check to [[Balance]]) or fall.

## Uneven Ground

Uneven ground is an area unsteady enough that you need to [[Balance]] (see Acrobatics) or risk falling [[Prone]] and possibly injuring yourself, depending on the specifics of the uneven ground. You are [[Off-Guard]] on uneven ground. Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on uneven ground, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the Acrobatics check to [[Balance]]) or fall prone.

## Inclines

An incline is an area so steep that you need to [[Climb]] using the Athletics skill in order to progress upward. You're [[Off-Guard]] hen [[Climb|Climbing]] an incline.
