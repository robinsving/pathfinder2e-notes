| Change | Hands | Action |
| Draw or put away a worn item, or pick up an item1 | 1 or 2 | Interact |
| Pass an item to or take an item from a willing creature2 | 1 or 2 | Interact |
| Drop an item to the ground | 1 or 2 | Release |
| Detach a shield or item strapped to you | 1 | Interact |
| Change your grip by removing a hand from an item | 2 | Release |
| Change your grip by adding a hand to an item | 2 | Interact |
| Retrieve an item from a backpack3, sack, or similar container | 2 | Interact |

1 If you retrieve a two-handed item with only one hand, you still need to change your grip before you can wield or use it.

2 A creature must have a hand free for someone to pass an item to them, and they might then need to change their grip if they receive an item requiring two hands to wield or use.

3 Retrieving an item stowed in your own backpack requires first taking off the backpack with a separate Interact action.
