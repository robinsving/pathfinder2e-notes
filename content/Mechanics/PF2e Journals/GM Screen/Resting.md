# Resting
Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day. Though resting typically happens at night, a group gains the same benefits for resting during the day. Either way, they can gain the benefits of resting only once every 24 hours. A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the following ways:

*   The character regains Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by their level. If they rest without any shelter or comfort, you might reduce this healing by half (to a minimum of 1 HP).
*   The character loses the [[fatigued]] condition.
*   The character reduces the severity of the [[doomed]] and [[drained]] conditions by 1.
*   Most spellcasters need to rest before they regain their spells for the day.

A group in exploration mode can attempt to rest, but they aren't entirely safe from danger, and their rest might be interrupted. The 8 hours of rest do not need to be consecutive, however, and after an interruption, characters can go back to sleep.

Sleeping in armor results in poor rest and causes a character to wake up fatigued. If a character would have recovered from fatigue, sleeping in armor prevents it.

If a character goes more than 16 hours without going to sleep, they become [[fatigued]].

Taking [[long-term rest]] for faster recovery is part of downtime and can't be done during exploration.

## Daily Preperations

Just before setting out to explore, or after a night's rest, the PCs spend time to prepare for the adventuring day. This typically happens over the span of 30 minutes to an hour in the morning, but only after 8 full hours of rest. Daily preparations include the following.

*   Spellcasters who prepare spells choose which spells they'll have available that day.
*   Focus Points and other abilities that reset during daily preparations refresh. This includes abilities that can be used only a certain number of times per day.
*   Each character equips their gear. This includes donning their armor and strapping on their weapons.
*   Characters invest up to 10 worn magic items to gain their benefits for the day (page 531).
