# Bulk Conversions for Different Sizes
As shown in the table below, Large or larger creatures are less encumbered by bulky items than Small or Medium creatures, while Tiny creatures become overburdened more quickly. A Large creature treats 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk, a Huge creature treats 10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk, and so on. A Tiny creature treats 10 items of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar wayâ€”a Huge creature treats items of 1 Bulk as negligible, so it can carry any number of items of 1 Bulk. A Tiny creature doesn't treat any items as having negligible Bulk.

| **Creature Size** | **Bulk Limit** | **Treats as Light** | **Treats as Negligible** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | Half | \- | none |
| Small or Med. | Standard | L | \- |
| Large | x2 | 1 Bulk | L |
| Huge | x4 | 2 Bulk | 1 Bulk |
| Gargantuan | x8 | 4 Bulk | 2 Bulk |
