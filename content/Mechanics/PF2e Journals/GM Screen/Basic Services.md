## Hireling

Paid laborers can provide services for you. Unskilled hirelings can perform simple manual labor and are untrained at most skills. Skilled hirelings have expert proficiency in a particular skill. Hirelings are level 0. If a skill check is needed, an untrained hireling has a +0 modifier, while a skilled hireling has a +4 modifier in their area of expertise and +0 for other skill checks. Hirelings' rates double if they're going adventuring with you.

## Transportation

The cost to hire transportation includes standard travel with no amenities. Most transit services provide basic sleeping arrangements, and some provide meals at the rates listed on the table above. Arranging transportation into dangerous lands can be more expensive or impossible.
