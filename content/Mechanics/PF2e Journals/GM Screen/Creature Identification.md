# Creature Identification
Use the creature's level, adjusted for rarity and fame. Success recalls a well-known attribute; critical success adds something more subtle.

| Creature Trait | Skills | Creature Trait | Skills |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Aberration** | Occultism | **Fey** | Nature |
| **Animal** | Nature | **Fiend** | Religion |
| **Astral** | Occultism | **Fungus** | Nature |
| **Beast** | Arcana, Nature | **Humanoid** | Society |
| **Celestial** | Religion | **Monitor** | Religion |
| **Construct** | Arcana, Crafting | **Ooze** | Occultism |
| **Dragon** | Arcana | **Plant** | Nature |
| **Elemental** | Arcana, Nature | **Spirit** | Occultism |
| **Ethereal** | Occultism | **Undead** | Religion |

A character who successfully identifies a creature learns one of its best-known attributesâ€”such as a troll's regeneration (and the fact that it can be stopped by acid or fire) or a manticore's tail spikes. On a critical success, the character also learns something subtler, like a demon's weakness or the trigger for one of the creature's reactions.

The skill used to identify a creature usually depends on that creature's trait, as shown on the table above, but you have leeway on which skills apply. For instance, hags are humanoids but have a strong connection to occult spells and live outside society, so you might allow a character to use Occultism to identify them without any DC adjustment, while Society is harder. Lore skills can also be used to identify their specific creature. Using the applicable Lore usually has an easy or very easy DC (before adjusting for rarity).
