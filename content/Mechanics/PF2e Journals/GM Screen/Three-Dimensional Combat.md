# Three-Dimensional Combat
In aerial and aquatic combat, you might need to track positioning in three dimensions. For flying creatures, you might use one of the following methods:

*   Find platforms to place flying creatures' miniatures on.
*   Set a die next to a creature with the number indicating how many squares up in the air it is.
*   Make a stack of dice or tokens, 1 per 5 feet of elevation.
*   Write the elevation next to the monster on the grid.

In underwater combat, choose a plane to be the baseline, typically the waterline, the sea floor, or a stationary object you can measure from.

As with ground-based movement, moving diagonally up or down in 3-D space requires counting every other diagonal as 10 feet. Measure flanking in all directionsâ€” creatures above and below an enemy can flank it just as effectively as they can from opposite sides.
