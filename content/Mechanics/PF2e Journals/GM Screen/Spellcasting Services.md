# Spellcasting Services
Spellcasting services, listed on the table below, are uncommon. Having a spell cast for you requires finding a spellcaster who knows and is willing to cast it. It's hard to find someone who can cast higher-level spells, and uncommon spells typically cost at least 100% more, if you can find someone who knows them at all. Spells that take a long time to cast (over 1 minute) usually cost 25% more. You must pay any cost listed in the spell in addition to the Price on the table.

| Spell Level | Price\* |  | Spell Level | Price\* |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 3 gp |  | 6th | 160 gp |  |
| 2nd | 7 gp |  | 7th | 360 gp |  |
| 3rd | 18 gp |  | 8th | 720 gp |  |
| 4th | 40 gp |  | 9th | 1,800 gp |  |
| 5th | 80 gp |  |  |  |  |
| \* Plus any cost required to cast the specific spell. |  |  |  |  |  |
