# Light Effects
The amount of light in an area can affect how well you see things. There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The rules in this book assume that all creatures are in bright light unless otherwise noted. A source of light lists the radius in which it sheds bright light, and it sheds dim light to double that radius.

## Bright Light

In bright light, such as sunlight, creatures and objects can be observed clearly by anyone with average vision or better. Some types of creatures are [[Dazzled]] or [[Blinded]] by bright light.

## Dim Light

Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the [[Concealed]] condition, unless the seeker has darkvision or low-light vision ([[Senses]]), or a precise sense other than vision.

## Darkness

A creature or object within darkness is hidden or undetected unless the seeker has darkvision or a precise sense other than vision ([[Senses]]). A creature without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness has the [[Blinded]] condition while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. If a creature can see into an illuminated area, it can observe creatures within that illuminated area normally. After being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make you [[Dazzled]] for a short time, as determined by the GM.
