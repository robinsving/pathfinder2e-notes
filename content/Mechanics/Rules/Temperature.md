Often, temperature doesn’t impose enough of a mechanical effect to worry about beyond describing the clothing the characters need to wear to be comfortable. Particularly hot and cold weather can make creatures [Fatigued](../Conditions/Fatigued.md) more quickly during overland travel and can cause damage if harsh enough, as shown in Table 10–13.

Appropriate cold-weather gear (such as the winter clothing) can negate the damage from severe cold or reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of particularly severe cold.

### Table 10-13: Temperature Effects
 | Category        | Temperature     | Fatigue | Damage                      |
 | --------------- | --------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
 | Incredible cold | -62°C or colder | 2 hours | Moderate cold every minute  |
 | Extreme col     | -61°C to -29°C  | 4 hours | Minor cold every 10 minutes |
 | Severe cold     | -28°C to -11°C  | 4 hours | Minor col every hour        |
 | Mild cold       | -10°C to 0°C    | 4 hours | None                        |
 | Normal          | 1°C to 34°C     | 8 hours | none                        |
 | Mild heat       | 35°C to 40°C*   | 4 hours | none                        |
 | Severe heat     | 41°C to 45°C*    | 4 hours | Minor fire every hour       |
 | Extreme heat    | 46°C to 59°C    | 4 hours | Minor fire every 10 minutes |
 | Incredible heat | 60°C or warmer  | 2 hours | Moderate fire every minute  |

* Adjust temperatures down by 9º C in areas of high humidity
