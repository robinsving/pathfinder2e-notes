# Starvation and Thirst
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 500 3.0

Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive comfortably. When they can't, they're [Fatigued](../Conditions/Fatigued.md) until they do. Without water, after a number of days equal to a creature's Constitution modifier + 1, the creature takes 1d4 damage each hour that can't be healed until it quenches its thirst. After the same amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day that can't be healed until it eats.
