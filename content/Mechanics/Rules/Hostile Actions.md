# Hostile Actions
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 305 3.0

---
Sometimes spell effects prevent a target from using [Hostile](../Conditions/Hostile.md) actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any [Hostile](../Conditions/Hostile.md) actions. A [Hostile](../Conditions/Hostile.md) action is one that can harm or damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm. For instance, lobbing a fireball into a crowd would be a [Hostile](../Conditions/Hostile.md) action, but opening a door and accidentally freeing a horrible monster would not be. The GM is the final arbitrator of what constitutes a [Hostile](../Conditions/Hostile.md) action.
