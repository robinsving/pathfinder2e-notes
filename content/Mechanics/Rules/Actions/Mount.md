# Mount
==[Move](../../Traits/Move.md)==

**Requirements.** You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.

---
You move onto the creature and ride it. If youâ€™re already mounted, you can instead use this action to dismount, moving off the mount into a space adjacent to it.
