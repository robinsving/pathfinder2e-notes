# Take Cover

**Requirements.** You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are **prone**.

---
You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of [Cover](../Cover.md). If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to Stealth checks to [Hide](Hide.md), [Sneak](Sneak.md), or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become unconscious, or end this effect as a free action.
