==[Attack](../../Traits/Attack.md)==

---
You attack with a weapon you're wielding or with an unarmed attack, targeting one creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within range (for a ranged attack). Roll the attack roll for the weapon or unarmed attack you are using, and compare the result to the target creature's AC to determine the effect. See Attack Rolls and Damage for details on calculating your attack and damage rolls.

- **Critical Success.** As success, but you deal double damage.
- **Success.** You deal damage according to the weapon or unarmed attack, including any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties you have to damage.
