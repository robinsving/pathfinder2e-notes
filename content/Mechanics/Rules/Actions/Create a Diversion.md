With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the [Manipulate](../../Traits/Manipulate.md) trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the [Auditory](../../Traits/Auditory.md) and [Linguistic](../../Traits/Linguistic.md) traits.

Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.

**Success** You become [Hidden](../../Conditions/Hidden.md) to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [Sneak](Sneak.md) away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except [Step](Step.md) or use the Hide or the Sneak action of the Stealth skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [Flat-footed](../../Conditions/Flat-footed.md) against that attack, and you then become [Observed](../../Conditions/Observed.md). If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.

**Failure** You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
