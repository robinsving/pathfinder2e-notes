# Attack of Opportunity

**Trigger.** A creature within your reach uses a [Manipulate](../../Traits/Manipulate.md) action or a [Move](../../Traits/Move.md) action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action itâ€™s using.

You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you  that action. This Strike doesnâ€™t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesnâ€™t apply to this Strike.
