# Point Out

==[Auditory](../../Traits/Auditory.md)== | ==[Manipulate](../../Traits/Manipulate.md)== | ==[Visual](../../Traits/Visual.md)==  
**Requirements.** A creature is undetected by one or more of your allies but isnâ€™t undetected by you.

---

You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [Hidden](../../Conditions/Hidden.md) to your allies, rather than [Undetected](../../Conditions/Undetected.md). This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target.

If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's Stealth DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
