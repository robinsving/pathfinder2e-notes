# Step

==[Move](../../Traits/Move.md)==  
**Requirements.** Your Speed is at least 10 feet.

---

You carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn't trigger reactions, such as [Attacks of Opportunity](Attack%20of%20Opportunity.md), that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.

You can't Step into [Difficult Terrain](../Difficult%20Terrain.md), and you can't Step using a Speed other than your land Speed.
