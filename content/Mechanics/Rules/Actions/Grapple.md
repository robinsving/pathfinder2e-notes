# Grapple

==[Attack](../../Traits/Attack.md)==  
__Source__ Core Rulebook pg. 242 3.0  
**Requirements** You have at least one free hand or have your target grappled or [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md). Your target isn't more than one size larger than you.

---

You attempt to grab a creature or object with your free hand. Attempt an Athletics check against the target's Fortitude DC. You can Grapple a target you already have [Grabbed](../../Conditions/Grabbed.md) or [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md) without having a hand free.

**Critical Success** Your target is [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.  
**Success** Your target is [Grabbed](../../Conditions/Grabbed.md) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.  
**Failure** You fail to grab your target. If you already had the target [Grabbed](../../Conditions/Grabbed.md) or [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md) using a Grapple, those conditions on that creature or object end.  
**Critical Failure** If you already had the target [Grabbed](../../Conditions/Grabbed.md) or [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md), it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land [Prone](../../Conditions/Prone.md).
