# Basic Saving Throws
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 449 3.0

---
Sometimes you will be called on to attempt a basic saving throw. This type of saving throw works just like any other saving throw—the “basic” part refers to the effects. For a basic save, you’ll attempt the check and determine whether you critically succeed, succeed, fail, or critically fail like you would any other saving throw. Then one of the following outcomes applies based on your degree of success—no matter what caused the saving throw.

**Critical Success** You take no damage from the spell, hazard, or effect that caused you to attempt the save.
**Success** You take half the listed damage from the effect.
**Failure** You take the full damage listed from the effect.
**Critical Failure** You take double the listed damage from the effect.
