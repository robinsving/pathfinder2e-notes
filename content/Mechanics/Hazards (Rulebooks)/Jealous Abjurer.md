**Stealth** DC 23 (master)
**Description** A robe-clad spirit rises out of the floor, pointing an accusing finger.
***
**Disable** DC 36 arcana, DC 36 nature, DC 36 occultism, or DC 36 religion (master) to convince the spirit that the target's magical knowledge is too great to be trifled with
___
**Rend Magic** `pf2:r`
#arcane 
**Trigger** A creature that is currently affected by a beneficial spell approaches within 30 feet of the abjurer.
**Effect** Envying the fame and magical prowess of others, the jealous abjurer attempts to engineer a catastrophic failure in the highest-level beneficial spell currently affecting its target. It attempts a counteract check with a +26 modifier. If the counteract check succeeds, the spell is dispelled, and the creature it had been affecting takes `dice: 4d12+30` force damage as the spell violently implodes (DC 32 reflex save).
