# Flensing Blades
#Hazard12 
#haunt 

**Stealth** DC 25 (expert)
**Description** A whirling tornado of spectrally propelled glass and steel slices whatever it touches to ribbons.
***
**Disable** DC 35 thievery (master) to precisely adjust the blades so that they destroy each other, or DC 38 religion (expert) to weaken the haunt; four successes are required to disable it
___
**Whirling Blades** `pf2:r`
**Trigger** Three or more creatures enter the area of the haunt
**Effect** Sharp fragments lift up from the ground and begin to spin in rapid circles taking up one 5-foot square. The haunt rolls initiative.
***
**Routine** (3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+10 slashing damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a DC: 33 reflex.
- **Critical Success:** The creature is unaffected.
- **Success:** The creature takes half damage.
- **Failure:** The creature takes full damage plus `dice: 1d10` bleed.
- **Critical Failure:** The creature takes double damage and `dice: 1d10` bleed. It also becomes [[Wounded|Wounded 1]] (or increases its wounded value by 1, if it is already wounded).
Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the haunt's movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely.
***
**Reset** The haunt draws jagged shards back into its area over the course of an hour, after which it can trigger again.
