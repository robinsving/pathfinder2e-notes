# Armageddon Orb

#magical 

**Stealth** DC 0 or detect magic
**Description** A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug's blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.
***
**Disable** DC 48 thievery (legendary) to imbue a thieves' toolkit with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb's power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes `dice: 5` fire damage each round until the orb is depleted
___
**Burn It All** `pf2:r`
#death #divine #fire 
**Trigger** A special condition set by the trap's creator occurs, typically the event of their death.
**Effect** Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing `dice: 10d6` fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.
