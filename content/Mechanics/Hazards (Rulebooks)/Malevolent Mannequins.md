**Routine** Routine (9 actions) Each of the mannequins uses three of the haunt's actions on each turn, and the haunt loses three actions each turn for every disabled or destroyed mannequin. Each mannequin uses its first action to Stride up to 50 feet and its remaining two actions to make clockwork fist Strikes. Each has its own separate multiple attack penalty.

**Reset** The haunt deactivates after it has no target creatures and resets, usually over the course of 1 round, as the mannequins move to their original positions.
