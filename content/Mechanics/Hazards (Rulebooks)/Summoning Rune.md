**Effect** This trap summons a specific 1st-level creature, determined when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and remains for `dice: 2d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
