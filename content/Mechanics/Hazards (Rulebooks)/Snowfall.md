# Snowfall
#Hazard0 
#environmental 

**Stealth** DC 6 (trained)
**Description** Loose snow and ice have built up on a high surface, such as a tree branch or a rooftop. Its grip on the surface is tenuous, and it is likely to fall if the surface moves.
***
**Disable** DC 19 survival (trained) to safely dislodge the snow, or deal any amount of fire damage to destroy the hazard without triggering it
___
**Snowdrop** `pf2:r`
**Trigger** A creature moves beneath where the snowfall is resting.
**Effect** Ice and snow fall on the triggering creature, dealing `dice: 2d6+3` bludgeoning damage (DC 18 reflex save) and soaking their clothing. Until they change into fresh clothing or spend at least an hour in an area of normal or higher temperature, they treat cold environments as one step colder (for example, mild cold as severe cold).
