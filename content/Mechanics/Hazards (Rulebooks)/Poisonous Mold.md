**Description** This grotesque fungus releases poisonous spores when a creature comes near.

The mold expands when fed by blood or decay. If at any point a creature takes bleed damage while adjacent to the mold or a dying or dead body is adjacent to the mold, the mold grows to expand into every square adjacent to its current space. This can happen only once per day.

5 feet. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the aura takes `dice: 2d6` poison damage.
