#mechanical #trap 

**Stealth** DC 8 (or 0 if the trapdoor is disabled or broken)
**Description** A wooden trapdoor covers a pit that's 10 feet square and 20 feet deep.
***
**Disable** DC 12 thievery to remove the trapdoor
___
**Pitfall** `pf2:r`
**Trigger** A creature walks onto the trapdoor.
**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage (typically `dice: 10` bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [[Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling.
***
**Reset** Creatures can still fall into the trap, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.
