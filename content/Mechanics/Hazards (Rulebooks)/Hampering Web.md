# Hampering Web
#Hazard1 
#environmental 

**Stealth** DC 8 (expert)
**Description** Semitransparent sheets of webbing span the entryway, ready to capture small insects or hamper larger creatures that pass through.
***
**Disable** DC 17 survival (trained) to dislodge it
___
**Ensnare** `pf2:r`
**Trigger** A creature that isn't a spider walks into the web
**Effect** The web wraps around the triggering creature's body, clinging to their limbs. The triggering creature must succeed at a DC: 20 reflex save or take a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds until they [[Escape]] the web (DC 20). On a critical failure, the webbing also clings to the creature's face, making them [[Sickened 1]], and they can't attempt to reduce this condition until they Escape the web.
