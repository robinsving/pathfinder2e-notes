**Stealth** DC 10 (expert)
**Description** A choir of lost souls rises out of the floor, singing an eerie chant that terrifies its listeners and buffets their bodies with walls of sound.
***
**Disable** DC 28 performance (trained) to disrupt the song's resonance with another tune or DC 28 religion (trained) to ritually silence the spirits
___
**Profane Chant** `pf2:r`
#auditory #emotion #fear #mental #occult 
**Trigger** A creature moves within 10 feet of the section of floor from which the choir can arise
**Effect** The choir rises, and its song deals `dice: 4d8+18` mental damage to non-evil creatures within 30 feet of the souls' spectral forms. Affected creatures must each attempt a DC 24 will save.

- **Success:** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].
- **Failure:** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].
