# Quicksand
#Hazard3 
#environmental 

**Stealth** DC 12 (trained) (or -10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed)
**Description** A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.
***
**Disable** DC 18 survival (trained) to disturb the surface
___
**Submerge** `pf2:0`
**Trigger** A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand
**Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn't already.
***
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 athletics check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it's submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is [[Prone]] in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
***
**Reset** The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn't become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.
