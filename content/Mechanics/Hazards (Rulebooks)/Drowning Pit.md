# Drowning Pit
#Hazard3 
#mechanical #trap 

**Stealth** DC 10 (trained); DC 22 perception (expert) to notice the water spouts once the pit opens
**Description** A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that's 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit.
***
**Disable** DC: 18 thievery (trained) to seal each water spout, DC: 22 thievery (trained) to open the trapdoor, or DC: 22 athletics to [[Force Open]] (Athletics) the trapdoor
___
**Pitfall** `pf2:r`
**Trigger** A creature walks onto the trapdoor
**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically `dice: 12` bludgeoning damage). A creature can [[Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.
***
**Routine** (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap's actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.
***
**Reset** The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks are refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders the pit less effective.
