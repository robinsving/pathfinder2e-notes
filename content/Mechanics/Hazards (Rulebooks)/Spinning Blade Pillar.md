# Spinning Blade Pillar
#Hazard4 
#mechanical #trap 

**Stealth** DC 11 (trained) or DC 26 perception (expert) to notice the control panel
**Description** A metal pole with three razor-sharp spinning blades is hidden in the floor, connected to trigger plates in up to eight floor tiles and a hidden control panel within 30 feet.
***
**Disable** DC 21 thievery (trained) twice on the pillar, or DC 19 thievery (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents the trap from deactivating automatically.

**Routine** (3 actions) The trap uses its first action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the direction), and its third to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature. This trap doesn't take a multiple attack penalty.
***
**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets after 1 minute.
