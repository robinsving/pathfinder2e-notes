# Warpwaves
<p>Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves.</p>
<p>When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature.</p>
<p>Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.</p>

| 1d8 | result |
|------|--------|

| 2 | [[Confused]] and gains `dice: 4d6` temporary Hit Points |
| 3 | [[Dazzled]] (permanent on a critical failure) |
| 4 | [[Enfeebled 1\|Enfeebled 2]] ([[Enfeebled 1\|Enfeebled 3]] on a critical failure) |
