# Sixth Pillar Mastery

You align your magical and physical potential. Whenever you succeed at an unarmed Strike against an opponent, they have a -1 status penalty to saves against your spells until the start of your next turn. Whenever you cast a spell using spell slots, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed Strikes until the start of your next turn.
