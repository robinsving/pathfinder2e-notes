# Anchoring Roots
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Small roots sprout from your feet, steadying you as you move. You gain the [[Steady Balance]] skill feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics, and you can use the [[Anchor]] action.
