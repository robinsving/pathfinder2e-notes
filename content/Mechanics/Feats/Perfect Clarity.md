# Perfect Clarity

**Trigger** You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save

* * *

You burn out all of your rage to ensure that your attack lands and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, use the better result, and resolve the effect. You then immediately stop raging.
