Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception, and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it.

It can see [Invisible](../../Conditions/Invisible.md) creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are [Concealed](../../Conditions/Concealed.md). When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be [disbelieved](../../Rules/Disbelieving%20an%20Illusion.md), the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to [Interact](../../Rules/Actions/Interact.md).

## Traits

**Evolution:**  
Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
