# Predictive Purchase (Rogue)

You somehow manage to have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[Prescient Planner]] and [[Prescient Consumable]] feats. When using Prescient Planner, you can draw the item from your backpack (or a similar container) as a 2-action activity, instead of taking 1 minute to do so.
