# Kreighton's Cognitive Crossover

**Trigger** You gain no information from a Recall Knowledge check (usually because you failed the secret check) using one of the two skills you chose for this feat.

* * *

Kreighton teaches his students that an agile mind can glean clues leading to the truth, even from the most unlikely of sources. You immediately reattempt the triggering check using the other chosen skill.

* * *

**Special** When you gain this feat, choose two of the following skills: Arcana, Crafting, Lore (any one), Medicine, Nature, Occultism, Religion, or Society.
