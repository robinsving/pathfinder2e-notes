# Rejuvenating Touch

Your healing energies linger after you cast, providing continual benefits.

An ally that recovers Hit Points from your _[[Lay on Hands]]_ gains 10 temporary Hit Points at the start of their turn during each of the next 10 rounds. This effect ends if the ally is knocked [[Unconscious]].
