# Prayer-Touched Weapon

**Frequency** once per turn

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip divine spell.

* * *

You coat a weapon you're wielding in prayers and the divine power given to you by your deity. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 vitality damage. As usual for vitality damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with void healing.
