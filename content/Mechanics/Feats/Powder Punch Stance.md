**Access** You're from Alkenstar or the Mana Wastes.

You infuse your handwraps with black powder. On your first melee Strike each round with an unarmed attack, [[Knuckle Duster]], or [[Black Powder Knuckle Dusters]], you deal an additional 1 fire Damage. If you critically succeed at an attempt to [[Shove]] while in this stance, the target is pushed back an additional 5 feet.
