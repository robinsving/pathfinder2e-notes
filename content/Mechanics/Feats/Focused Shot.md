# Focused Shot

**Requirements** You are in [[Monastic Archer Stance]].

* * *

You achieve a state of perfect calm before unleashing your attack, opening your mind to the minute movements of the world around you to increase your accuracy.

Make a ranged weapon Strike against a target within your weapon's first range increment. This Strike ignores the target's [[Concealed]] condition and all cover.
