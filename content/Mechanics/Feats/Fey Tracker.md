You are exceptionally skilled at noticing the subtle techniques fey use to avoid notice. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to [[Track]] fey creatures, to Perception checks to [[Seek]] for [[Hidden]] fey, and to your Perception DC to resist a fey creature's attempt to [[Create a Diversion]].
