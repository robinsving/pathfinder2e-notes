# Alchemical Scholar

You learn formulas more easily. You gain four common 1st-level alchemical formulas when you take this feat, and each time you gain a level, you gain a common alchemical formula of that level. You still need [[Alchemical Crafting]] to Craft alchemical items.

**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
