# Lion's Might

You've trained with the weapons of the Bright Lions. You gain access to [[Lion Scythe|Lion Scythes]] and [[Sun Sling|Sun Slings]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank with lion scythes and sun slings.
