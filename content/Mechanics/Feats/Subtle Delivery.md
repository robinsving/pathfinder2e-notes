# Subtle Delivery

You can capably deliver toxins with a [[Blowgun]]. Your blowgun [[Strike|Strikes]] can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance.

If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.
