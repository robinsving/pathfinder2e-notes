# Elaborate Flourish

You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter.

If the next action you use is to [[Cast a Spell]], creatures with the ability to Cast that Spell don't automatically know what the spell is.

In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a -2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with [[Recall Knowledge]] and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with [[Counterspell (Prepared)|Counterspell]]).
