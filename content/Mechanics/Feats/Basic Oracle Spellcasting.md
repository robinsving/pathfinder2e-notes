# Basic Oracle Spellcasting

You gain the [[Spellcasting Archetypes#Basic Spellcasting Feat|Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits. When you gain a spell slot of a new rank from the oracle archetype, add a common divine spell or another divine spell you have learned or discovered to your repertoire, of that spell level.
