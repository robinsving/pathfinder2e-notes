# Mischievous Tail
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your tail can bedevil your foes. You can Disarm and Trip creatures with your tail, even if you don't have a free hand. All restrictions of Skillful Tail otherwise continue to apply. If you have Smashing Tail, your tail unarmed attack gains the disarm and trip traits.
