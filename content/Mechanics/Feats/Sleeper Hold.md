# Sleeper Hold

**Requirements** You have a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]].

* * *

You pinch crucial points of your target's nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target falls [[Unconscious]] for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn't drop what it holds.

**Success** The target is [[Clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn.
