# Incredible Ferocity
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Given time to collect yourself after a near-death scrape, you can rebuild your ferocity and withstand additional finishing blows. You can use Orc Ferocity with a frequency of once per hour, rather than once per day.
