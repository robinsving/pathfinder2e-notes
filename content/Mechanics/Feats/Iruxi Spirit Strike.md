# Iruxi Spirit Strike
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your iruxi unarmed attacks channel the spiritual energy of your ancestors. Any unarmed attacks you acquire from iruxi heritages or ancestry feats gain the effects of a [[Ghost Touch]] property rune.
