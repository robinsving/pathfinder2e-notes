# Tail Snatch
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can whip your tail around to lash items from the unwary's grip. You attempt to [[Disarm]] a creature, ignoring the requirement that you must have at least one hand free. As normal, your tail can't hold the items it disarms.
