# Grit and Tenacity

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a Fortitude or Will save.

* * *

You call upon deep reserves of toughness and mental fortitude to power through an otherwise debilitating effect. Reroll the triggering save with a +2 circumstance bonus; you must use the second result.
