![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike, and either you have a hand free or your Strike used a grapple weapon.

* * *

You grab your foe while it's distracted by your attack. The foe you hit becomes [[Grabbed]], as if you had succeeded at an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] the foe.
