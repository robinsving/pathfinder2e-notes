# Locate Lawbreakers

Your pursuit is relentless, and you are able to magically locate stolen objects and outlaws. You gain _[[Locate]]_ as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day. If you are a member of the Order of the Gate, when you reach 14th level, the spell is heightened to 5th level.
