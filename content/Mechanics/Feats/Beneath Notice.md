# Beneath Notice

You are skilled at hiding from your foes and targets among the common populace. You gain the [[Quick Disguise]] and [[Slippery Secrets]] skill feats.

In addition, while in a crowd, you can [[Impersonate]] a nondescript member of the crowd as a three action activity (one action if you are legendary in Deception)
