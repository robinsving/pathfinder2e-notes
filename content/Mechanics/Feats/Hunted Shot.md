# Hunted Shot

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon with reload 0.

* * *

You take two quick shots against the one you hunt. Make two Strikes against your prey with the required weapon. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to each Strike normally.
