# Elemental Shape

You understand the fundamental elements of nature such that you can imbue them into your body and manifest as a living embodiment of those elements. Add the shapes in [[Elemental Form]] to your [[Untamed Form]] list. Whenever you're polymorphed into another shape using _untamed form_, you gain resistance 5 to fire.
