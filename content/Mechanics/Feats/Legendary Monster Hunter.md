# Legendary Monster Hunter
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your knowledge of monsters is so incredible that it reveals glaring flaws in your prey. Your bonus from [[Monster Hunter]] (and the bonus from [[Monster Warden]] if you have it) increases from +1 to +2 for you and any allies who benefit.
