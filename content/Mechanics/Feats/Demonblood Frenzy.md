# Demonblood Frenzy

**Access** Matanji ethnicity

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You successfully Strike a living creature that has the fiend trait with your tusks unarmed attack.

* * *

Just the taste of fiendish blood is enough to send blood rushing through your veins in a supernatural fury. You become [[Quickened]] until the end of your next turn and you can use the extra action to make a tusks Strike, Stride, or Step.
