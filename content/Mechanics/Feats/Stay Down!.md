# Stay Down!

**Trigger** A [[Prone]] foe within your reach Stands.

* * *

You have ways of keeping your foes down. Attempt an athletics check against the triggering foe's Fortitude DC. On a success, the action is disrupted, causing the creature to remain prone. On a critical success, the creature also can't Stand until its next turn.
