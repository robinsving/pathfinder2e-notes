# Timber Sentinel
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A slim, symmetrical tree travels from the Plane of Wood. You conjure a tree within 30 feet, as a _[[Protector Tree]]_ spell of a rank equal to half your level rounded up. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends, and an ordinary tree remains.
