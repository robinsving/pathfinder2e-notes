# Insect Shape

Your understanding of life expands, allowing you to mimic a wider range of creatures. Add the shapes in [[Insect Form]] to your [[Untamed Form]] list. Whenever you use _untamed form_ to polymorph into the non-flying insect shapes listed in pest form, the duration is 24 hours instead of 10 minutes.
