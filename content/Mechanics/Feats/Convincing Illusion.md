# Convincing Illusion

**Trigger** A creature succeeded, but didn't critically succeed, at a Perception check or Will save to disbelieve an illusion from a spell that you cast.

**Requirements** You are within 30 feet of the observer and the illusion.

* * *

You use your deceptive skills to make your illusions seem even more real. Attempt a deception check against the target's Perception DC. If you succeed, the target fails to disbelieve the illusion.
