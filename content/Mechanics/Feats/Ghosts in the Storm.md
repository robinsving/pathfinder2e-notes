# Ghosts in the Storm

Clouds, like eager pets, are drawn to you and to those in your good graces. Fast-moving gray clouds surround you, as well as your allies while they're in your kinetic aura. Anyone surrounded by these clouds gains a +2 status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks. When an affected creature uses a move action, clouds dance around it. Until the start of its next turn, it's [[Concealed]], and its Strikes gain the _[[Shock]]_ rune.
