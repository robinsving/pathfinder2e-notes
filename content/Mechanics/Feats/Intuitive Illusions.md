# Intuitive Illusions

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your turn begins.

Illusion magic comes to you so naturally that you can effortlessly sustain your magical ruses. You immediately gain the effects of a [[Sustain|Sustain a Spell]] action to extend the duration of one of your active illusion spells.
