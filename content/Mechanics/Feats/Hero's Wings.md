# Hero's Wings

You have begun the final steps to reaching your full potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form without you needing to use [[Energize Wings]], granting you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the [[Glad-Hand]] skill feat against other sprites, without taking a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.
