You crumble to pieces, becoming composed of the very terrain to which you're bound, with the effects of the gaseous form spell, or you reconstitute into your normal form. The substance you're formed of depends upon your bound terrain, and the action gains the corresponding trait or traits.

**Arctic** Snow (water)

**Desert** Sand (earth)

**Mountain** Cloud (water)

**Swamp** Mud (earth, water)
