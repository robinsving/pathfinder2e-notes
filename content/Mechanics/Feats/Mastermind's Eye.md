# Mastermind's Eye

When you succeed at identifying a creature using Recall Knowledge, that creature is [[Off-Guard]] against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's off-guard against your attacks for 1 minute. This feat serves as the rogue's mastermind racket for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
