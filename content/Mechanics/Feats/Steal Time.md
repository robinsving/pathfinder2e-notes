# Steal Time

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You reach into another creature's timeline and attempt to alter their flow of time. Select a creature within 30 feet. That creature attempts a DC resolve fortitude saving throw against your chronoskimmer DC. The creature takes the effects of _[[Slow]]_ based on the result of its saving throw.
