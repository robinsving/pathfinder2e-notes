# Crane Stance

**Requirements** You are unarmored

* * *

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for High Jump and Long Jump by 5, and when you Leap, you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
