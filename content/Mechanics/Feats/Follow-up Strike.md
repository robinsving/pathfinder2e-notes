# Follow-up Strike

**Requirements** Your last action was a missed Strike with a melee unarmed attack.

* * *

You have trained to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage.

Make another Strike with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as for the missed Strike, if any.
