# Brains!

**Trigger** You Feast upon a humanoid's brain. The humanoid can't be mindless (or, if you're Feasting on a corpse, can't have been mindless while alive).

* * *

You consume the brains of your foe, causing synapses long rotten to fire and enabling you to shake off your mental torpor. You gain a +1 status bonus on skill checks to Recall Knowledge for 1 hour. If the humanoid had a higher modifier to the skill check you're using to Recall Knowledge than you do, the status bonus increases to +2.
