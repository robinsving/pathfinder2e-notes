# Grim Insight

Others' attempts to scare you often grant you insights about your would-be bullies that you can then exploit. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead, and the source of the fear effect is [[Off-Guard]] to you until the end of your next turn.
