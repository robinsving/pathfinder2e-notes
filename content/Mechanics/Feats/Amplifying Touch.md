# Amplifying Touch

Your healing energies empower attacks.

An ally that recovers Hit Points from your _[[Lay on Hands]]_ gains a +1 status bonus to their attack rolls and deals 1 additional spirit damage on all their Strikes until the end of their next turn. In addition, all their Strikes are holy until the end of their next turn.
