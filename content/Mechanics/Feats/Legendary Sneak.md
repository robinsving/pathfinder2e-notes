# Legendary Sneak

You're always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there's nowhere to hide. You can [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] even without cover or being [[Concealed]]. When you employ an exploration tactic other than [[Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], you also gain the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to.
