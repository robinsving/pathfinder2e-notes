# Knockback Strike

You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed Strike. If you hit, attempt an Athletics check to [[Shove]] the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your Strike, and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
