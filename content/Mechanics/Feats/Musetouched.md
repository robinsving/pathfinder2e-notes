# Musetouched

Your blood sings with the liberating power of the azatas, living embodiments of freedom from the wild realm of Elysium. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Escape]]. When you roll a critical failure on a check to Escape, you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
