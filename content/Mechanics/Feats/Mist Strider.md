# Mist Strider

You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight. When you use [[Water Strider]], you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you don't end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
