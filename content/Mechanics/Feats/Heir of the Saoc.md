# Heir of the Saoc

In the past, you would have been a proud initiate of the Saoc Brethren. Today, you carry on their legacy. When you use Saoc Astrology, roll `dice: 1d4` instead; on a 1, you take a -1 penalty to the skill check. On any other result, you gain a circumstance bonus of that value (for instance, a +3 circumstance bonus on a 3).
