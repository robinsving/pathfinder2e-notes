# Twin Riposte

**Trigger** A creature within your reach critically fails to Strike you.

**Requirements** You are benefiting from [[Twin Parry]].

* * *

A clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee Strike or [[Disarm]] action against the triggering opponent.
