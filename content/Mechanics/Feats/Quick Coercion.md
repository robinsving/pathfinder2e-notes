# Quick Coercion
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can bully others with just a few choice implications. You can [[Coerce]] a creature after 1 round of conversation instead of 1 minute. You still can't Coerce a creature in the midst of combat, or without engaging in a conversation.
