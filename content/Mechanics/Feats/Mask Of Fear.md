# Mask Of Fear

**Trigger** You start your turn with the [[Frightened]] condition.

**Requirements** You're wearing your _warmask_.

* * *

Your _warmask_ burns off of your face, releasing your apprehension. You remove the frightened condition. Your _warmask_ is destroyed, and you can't reapply it until your next daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** You can use this free action even if you have a condition tied to the frightened condition that would normally prevent you from using a free action, such as “[[Fleeing]] as long as you're frightened” or “[[Paralyzed]] as long as you're frightened.”
