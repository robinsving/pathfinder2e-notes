# Halcyon Speaker Dedication

You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells. In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Halcyon Speaker]] archetype.
