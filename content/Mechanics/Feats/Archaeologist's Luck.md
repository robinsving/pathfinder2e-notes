# Archaeologist's Luck

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a check against a trap, such as a Thievery check to [[Disable a Device|Disable]] the trap or a Reflex save to avoid its effects.

* * *

You are more than just skillful; your drive to find the secrets of the past manifests as a strange kind of luck. Reroll the failed check and use the new result.
