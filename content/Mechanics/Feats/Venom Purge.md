# Venom Purge

**Frequency** once per day

You produce a specialized venom that burns out other toxins and impurities in your body. For each disease or poison currently affecting you, attempt a Medicine check to counteract that disease or poison. As normal, your counteract level is equal to half your level rounded up.
