# Impassable Wall Stance
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You refuse to let foes past your guard. As long as you are in this stance, when you critically hit with an [[Mechanics/Character Building/Actions/Reactive Strike]] triggered by a move action, you disrupt that move action.
