# Signature Spell Expansion (Psychic)
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your direct mental grasp of your power lets you cast more spells with greater freedom. You gain two additional signature spells, each of which must have a minimum level of 3rd or lower.
