# Gathering Moss

**Trigger** You enter Tenacious Stance.

* * *

By rooting yourself in place, you are able to focus your body's natural healing to work faster. You gain fast healing equal to your level. This fast healing remains for 1 minute or until you end your Tenacious Stance, whichever comes first.
