# Quick Identification
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can Identify Magic swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using Identify Magic to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you're a master, it takes a 3-action activity, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 action.
