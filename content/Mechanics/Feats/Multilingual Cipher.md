# Multilingual Cipher

You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Decipher Writing]].

If another creature attempts to Decipher Writing you encoded, they take a -2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages you used when you created the writing.
