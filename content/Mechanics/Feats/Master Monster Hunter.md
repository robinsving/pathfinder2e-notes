# Master Monster Hunter

You have a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of all creatures of the world. You can use Nature to [[Recall Knowledge]] to identify any creature. In addition, you gain the benefits of [[Monster Hunter]] (and [[Monster Warden]], if you have it) on a success as well as a critical success.
