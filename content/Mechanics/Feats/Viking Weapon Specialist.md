# Viking Weapon Specialist

You are even more skilled in the weapons of your people. You gain the critical specialization effects of the [[Battle Axe]], [[Hatchet]], [[Longsword]], and [[Shortsword]].

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in the above four weapons.
