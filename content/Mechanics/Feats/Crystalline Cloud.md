# Crystalline Cloud

When you use [[Crystalline Dust]], you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10 foot emanation{10-foot-radius} cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait.

All creatures within the cloud become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.
