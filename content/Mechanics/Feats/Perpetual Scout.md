# Perpetual Scout

You spot anything out of place in the areas you know best. While in your [[Favored Terrain]], you always gain the benefits of the [[Scout]] exploration activity, even if you are performing another exploration activity.

If you're legendary in Survival, you gain these benefits in any terrain.
