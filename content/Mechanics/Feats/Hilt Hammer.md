# Hilt Hammer
![[Mechanics/Character Building/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to turn any weapon into a bone-crushing implement of skeletal destruction. Melee weapons you wield gain the versatile B trait. You can use the weapon only to deal bludgeoning damage when making melee attacks. At the GM's discretion, specific weapons might not be able to gain the versatile B trait.
