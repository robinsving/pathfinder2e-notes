# Signature Synergy

Your eidolon gains an evolution integral to its form, and it comes more easily than your other synergies. You gain one evolution feat from the following list:

*   [[Airborne Form]]
*   [[Burrowing Form]]
*   [[Ever-Vigilant Senses]]
*   [[Hulking Size]]

For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your summoner level is equal to your character level - 4.
