# Fatal Bullet

You're especially talented at striking your enemies in their most vulnerable areas. When you critically hit with a fatal firearm, you deal an additional die of the appropriate size and damage type for the fatal trait after doubling the weapon's damage. For example, after getting a critical hit with a fatal d12 weapon, you add an additional 1d12 damage to the attack after doubling its damage.
