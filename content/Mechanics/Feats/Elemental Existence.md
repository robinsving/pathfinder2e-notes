# Elemental Existence

Your body becomes infused with elemental earth. You gain the [[Adopted Ancestry]] feat and gain a 1st level oread ancestry feat as a bonus feat, ignoring the limitations of the lineage trait. When you gain new ancestry feats, you can select oread feats in addition to feats allowed by your ancestry and heritage.
