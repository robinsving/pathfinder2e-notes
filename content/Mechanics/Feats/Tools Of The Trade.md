# Tools Of The Trade

You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: [[Bola]], [[Sap]], and [[Whip]]. You gain access to bolas. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.

In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait.
