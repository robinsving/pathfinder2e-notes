# Wildborn Adept

The whispers of the jungle grant you more diverse access to simple primal magic. You can cast _[[Light]]_, _[[Vitality Lash]]_ and _[[Tangle Vine]]_ as innate primal spells at will. If you chose one of those spells with Wildborn Magic, you can select a new spell for Wildborn Magic.
