# Suli Amir

You have power connected to the powerful jann amirs. You can cast _[[Read Omens]]_ and 4th-level _[[Invisibility]]_ each once per day as arcane innate spells, and you can cast _detect magic_ at will as an arcane innate cantrip, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
