# Rimesoul

The water inside you is cold and frozen, like sheets of ice and frigid glaciers. You gain resistance to cold equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less severe (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
