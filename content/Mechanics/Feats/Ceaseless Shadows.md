# Ceaseless Shadows

You excel at going unnoticed, especially among a crowd. You no longer need to have cover or be [[Concealed]] to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]]. If you would have lesser cover from a creature, you gain standard cover instead and can [[Take Cover]]; if you would have standard cover from a creature, you gain greater cover instead.
