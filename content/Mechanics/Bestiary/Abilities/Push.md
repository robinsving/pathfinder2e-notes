Requirements The monster’s last action was a success with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry. Effect The monster automatically knocks the target away from the monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description, the creature is [pushed](../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit, this distance is doubled.
