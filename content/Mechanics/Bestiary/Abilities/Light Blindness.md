# Light Blindness

_Source_ Bestiary pg. 343

When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [Blinded](../../Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it’s [Dazzled](../../Conditions/Dazzled.md).
