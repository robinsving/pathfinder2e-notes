Your eidolon is a lost soul, bound to the mortal world by undying anger or a bitter grudge. Most phantom eidolons are humanoids with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms. Your link with your eidolon prevents it from succumbing to corruption and undeath. Together, you will need to decide whether to work with your eidolon to control its anger, or channel its wrath into power.

## Furious Strike

==[Eidolon](../../../Traits/Eidolon.md)==  
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 60 1.1

Your eidolon channels its anger into a furious attack. It makes a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, your eidolon deals an extra die of weapon damage and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.

If you're at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice with a +2 circumstance bonus, and if you're at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice with a +3 circumstance bonus.

## Seething Frenzy (7th) ►

==[Concentrate](../../../Traits/Concentrate.md)== ==[Eidolon](../../../Traits/Eidolon.md)== ==[Emotion](../../../Traits/Emotion.md)== ==[Mental](../../../Traits/Mental.md)==  
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 60 1.1

Your eidolon's fury boils over into a reckless, out-of-control frenzy. While frenzied, your eidolon is affected by boost eidolon and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, but it takes a –2 penalty to AC. Your eidolon can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which it's [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md) for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.

## Anger Aura (17th)

Your eidolon exudes wrath in an aura around it, rousing the ire of nearby creatures and causing their defenses to crack as they seethe with rage. Your eidolon gains a 20-foot anger aura, which has the aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, and occult traits. The resistances of any creature in the aura, including you, your allies, your enemies, and your eidolon, are reduced by an amount equal to 3 + your eidolon's Constitution modifier.

Your eidolon can hold in its rage by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This reduces the aura's effect to affect only your eidolon. It can take this action again to reinstate the full effect of its aura. Creatures in a barbarian Rage, Seething Frenzy, or similar ability that allows them to channel their anger aren't affected by the anger aura.
