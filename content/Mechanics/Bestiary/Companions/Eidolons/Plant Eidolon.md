Your eidolon is an intelligent plant, formed from the same disembodied fragments of nature's life energy that become leshys. Plant eidolons tend to be curious and adaptable, with temperaments based on the parts of mortal culture they feel affinity toward. Despite coming from the same source, plant eidolons don't always look like leshys.

Plant eidolons have forms that vary greatly and can look like almost any kind of plant creature in existence. Some even resemble plant creatures so strange they are impossible to identify.

## Tendril Strike ►

==[Eidolon](../../../Traits/Eidolon.md)==  
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 65 1.1

Stretching to extend its body to its limits, your eidolon attacks a foe that would normally be beyond its reach. Your eidolon makes a melee [Unarmed](../../../Traits/Unarmed.md) Strike, increasing its reach by 5 feet for that Strike. If the unarmed attack has the disarm, shove, or trip trait, the eidolon can use the corresponding action instead of a Strike.

## Growing Vines (7th)

Your eidolon's vines and branches lengthen even more. All your eidolon's melee unarmed attacks gain the reach trait.

## Field of Roots (17th) ►►

==[Eidolon](../../../Traits/Eidolon.md)==  
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 66 1.1

Your eidolon extends its roots underground to entangle and possibly damage all foes nearby. All enemies within your eidolon's reach take damage of the same type and amount as your eidolon's most damaging Strike, depending on their Reflex saves. Any ongoing effects of the save last until the enemy either Escapes or leaves your eidolon's reach.

After using Field of Roots, your eidolon is [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) until it takes a single action, which has the [Manipulate](../../../Traits/Manipulate.md) trait, to detach from the ground; this also ends any remaining effects on enemies from Field of Roots.

__Critical Success__ The enemy is unaffected.  
__Success__ The enemy takes no damage, but takes a –10 foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds.  
__Failure__ The enemy takes half damage, takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and, at the end of each of its turns, takes half damage again.  
__Critical Failure__ The enemy is immobilized, takes full damage, and, at the end of each of its turns, takes full damage again.
