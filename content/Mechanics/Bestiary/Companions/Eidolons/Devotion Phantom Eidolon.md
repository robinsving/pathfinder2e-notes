Your eidolon is a lost soul, unable to escape the mortal world due to a strong sense of duty, an un[Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) devotion, or a need to complete an important task. Most phantom eidolons are humanoid with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms.  
Your link with your eidolon prevents them from succumbing to corruption and undeath, and together, you will grow in strength and fulfill your phantom's devotion.

__Trigger__ An enemy within 15 feet of you hits you with a Strike and deals damage to you.  
__Requirements__ Your eidolon is within 15 feet of you.

Your eidolon instinctively flashes with ectoplasmic energy, allowing them to strike back against an enemy who dares to harm you. Your eidolon makes a melee unarmed Strike against the triggering enemy, even if that enemy isn't within your eidolon's reach.

## Steadfast Devotion (7th)

Your eidolon's dedication makes it extremely challenging for your foes to bend its mind. Your eidolon gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [Mental](../../../Traits/Mental.md) effects, and if they roll a success against such an effect, they get a critical success instead. If you have the shared resolve class feature and your eidolon rolls a critical failure against a mental effect, they get a failure instead.

## Devotion Aura (17th)

After fighting at your side for so long, your eidolon has become as devoted to protecting you and your allies as it is to its original cause. It gains a 20-foot devotion aura, which has the [Abjuration](../../../Traits/Abjuration.md), [Aura](../../../Traits/Aura.md), and [Occult](../../../Traits/Occult.md) traits. Whenever one of your eidolon's allies within the aura takes damage, you can reduce the damage by your eidolon's Constitution modifier. You lose a number of Hit Points equal to half the amount by which the eidolon reduced the damage, rounded down. If the damage was lower than the Constitution modifier, base the damage you take on the actual amount of damage prevented.
