Because dragons have a strong connection to magic, their minds can often leave an echo floating in the Astral Plane. Such an entity is extremely powerful but unable to interact with the outside world on its own.

Dragon eidolons manifest in the powerful, scaled forms they had in life; most take the form of true dragons (albeit smaller), but some manifest as drakes or other draconic beings. You have forged a connection with such a dragon eidolon and together, you seek to grow as powerful as an ancient wyrm.

## Breath Weapon ►►

*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 64 1.1

Your eidolon has a powerful breath weapon, which they are able to use regularly to wreak havoc upon your foes. They gain the Breath Weapon activity. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, or poison, and choose whether the area is a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. Unless you chose piercing damage, both Breath Weapon and your eidolon gain the trait matching the damage type.

Your eidolon exhales a blast of destructive energy. Your eidolon deals `dice: 1d6|avg` damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The area and damage type of the Breath Weapon are chosen when the eidolon gains this ability. Your eidolon then can't use their Breath Weapon again for the next `dice: 1d4|avg` rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.

## Draconic Frenzy (7th) ►►

*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 64 1.1

Your eidolon makes one Strike with their primary [Unarmed](../../../Traits/Unarmed.md) attack and two Strikes with their secondary unarmed attack (in any order). If any of these attacks critically hits an enemy, your eidolon instantly recovers the use of their Breath Weapon.

## Wyrm's Breath (17th) ▬

==[Concentrate](../../../Traits/Concentrate.md)== ==[Eidolon](../../../Traits/Eidolon.md)==  
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 64 1.1  
__Frequency__ once per minute

Your eidolon gathers the power of the mightiest wyrms to make its magical breath even more spectacular. If your eidolon's next action is to use Breath Weapon, both the number of damage dice and area of the Breath Weapon are doubled.
