Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a [[mental]] effect, this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.\n__Failure__ The creature is [[fascinated]].\n__Critical Failure__ As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a [[fascinated]] creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it stays still and doesn't act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends."
