# Invested
#pf2e/trait 
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 633 3.0

A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasnâ€™t invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).
