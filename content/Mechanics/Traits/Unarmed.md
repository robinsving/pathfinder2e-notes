# Unarmed
#pf2e/trait 
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 283 3.0

An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be [Disarmed](../Rules/Actions/Disarm.md). It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a [Free-Hand](Free-Hand.md) weapon.
