# Magical
#pf2e/trait 
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 633 3.0

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.

Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the [Arcane](Arcane.md), [Divine](Divine.md), [Occult](Occult.md), or [Primal](Primal.md) trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.
