# Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder

The Forsaken patron of failed heroics, imprisonment, and squandered time.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
