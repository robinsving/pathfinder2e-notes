# Gyronna

The goddess **Gyronna** is also known as the Angry Hag, and for good reason.

**Edicts** Expose hypocrisy (real or imagined) in others, make other creatures miserable, demand bribes to spare creatures from your torments

**Anathema** Allow others to slight you without retaliation, seek the approval of society, forgive those who have wronged you
