Requirements You are piloting Bunta
Effect A silver river flows from your heart, traveling forward in a line that flows around obstacles as if it were water. If Bunta travels at least its speed along the river each round for 10 minutes, you arrive at another plane as if you cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ]{Interplanar Teleport}. You arrive in a destination you specify, or a random location if you don&#x27;t have a choice. If Bunta ever does not travel at least its Speed in a round, you can disrupt this activation. If you continue, you have a 1% cumulative chance of ending up in a random extraplanar location for each round that Bunta did not travel at least its Speed, to a maximum of a 60% chance if Bunta didn&#x27;t travel at least its Speed for the full 10 minutes. As long as you remain on Bunta, you are protected from any harmful effects of the plane&#x27;s environment."
