**Cast** ►► verbal
**Area** 5-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 minute

---
Your performance enraptures those who hear it, compelling them to follow you about in admiration. Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day.

Once per turn, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can Dismiss the spell.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [Fascinated](../../../Conditions/Fascinated.md) with you.
**Failure** The creature uses all its actions to move toward you and compliment your performance. This effect ends if a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action is used against the affected creature.
**Critical Failure** The target gains the [Minion](../../../Traits/Minion.md) trait and is [Controlled](../../../Conditions/Controlled.md) by you. This effect ends if a hostile action is used against the affected creature, or if you direct the creature to use any action that causes it harm.
