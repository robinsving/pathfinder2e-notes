Your body sprouts a coat of brambly thorns that harm those that strike you and thrive on life magic. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that hit you with unarmed attacks, take 1 piercing damage each time they do. Anytime you cast a positive spell, the damage from your thorns increases to `dice: 1d6|avg` until the start of your next turn.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1, or `dice: 1d6|avg` after you cast a positive spell.
