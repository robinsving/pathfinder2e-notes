You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed Strikes as ranged Strikes against targets within 30 feet. These deal `dice: 1d6|avg` bludgeoning damage, use the brawling group, and have the [Agile](../../../Traits/Agile.md), [Nonlethal](../../../Traits/Nonlethal.md), [Propulsive](../../../Traits/Propulsive.md), and [Unarmed](../../../Traits/Unarmed.md) traits. Wind crash Strikes ignore concealment and all cover.

While in wild winds stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
