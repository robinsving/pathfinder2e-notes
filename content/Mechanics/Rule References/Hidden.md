While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using [Stealth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=15) to [Hide](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=62). When [Seeking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) a creature using only [imprecise senses](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=412), it remains hidden, rather than [observed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=27). A creature you're hidden from is [flat-footed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.  
  
A creature might be able to use the Seek action to try to observe you.
