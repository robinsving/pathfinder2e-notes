With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the [manipulate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=104) trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the [auditory](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=16) and [linguistic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=101) traits.  
  
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.  
  
**Success** You become [hidden](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [Sneak](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=63) away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the [Hide](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=62) or the Sneak action of the [Stealth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=15) skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [flat-footed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) against that attack, and you then become [observed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=27). If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.  
**Failure** You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.

## [Impersonate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=46)

[Concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=32) [Exploration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=66) [Manipulate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=104) [Secret](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=142)

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [disguise kit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=19), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.  
  
In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the [Seek](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) action to attempt Perception checks against your [Deception](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5) DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.  
  
**Success** You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.  
**Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.  
**Critical Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.

[Auditory](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=16) [Concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=32) [Linguistic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=101) [Mental](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=106) [Secret](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=142)

You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.  
  
At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.  
  
**Success** The target believes your lie.  
**Failure** The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
