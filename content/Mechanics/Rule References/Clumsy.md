# Clumsy

**Source** [_Core Rulebook pg. 618_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1) [4.0](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1)  
Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using [Acrobatics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=1), [Stealth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=15), and [Thievery](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=17).
