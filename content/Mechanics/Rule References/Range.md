# Range

**Source** [_Core Rulebook pg. 279_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1) [4.0](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1)  
Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment. Attacks with these weapons work normally up to that distance. Attack rolls beyond a weapon’s range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple of that increment between you and the target. Attacks beyond the sixth range increment are impossible.  
  
For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away, and so on, up to 360 feet.
