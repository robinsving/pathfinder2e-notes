### Description

You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special abilities: _anarchic_, _axiomatic_, _holy_, or _unholy_. If _anarchic_, this spell has the chaos descriptor; if _axiomatic_, the law descriptor; if _holy_, the good descriptor; and if _unholy_, the evil descriptor. If the caster attempts to place a special ability on a weapon that already has that special ability, the spell fails.  
  
If a warpriest casts this spell on his sacred weapon, the duration doubles. Warpriests with unarmed strike as a sacred weapon can cast this spell on their unarmed strike.
