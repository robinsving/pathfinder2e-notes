# Flame Order

You feel a kinship with flames and can use them for succor and destruction. You're trained in Acrobatics. You also gain the [[Fire Lung]] druid feat. You gain the _[[Wildfire]]_ order spell. Allowing unnatural fires to spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).
