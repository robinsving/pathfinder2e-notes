# Greater Natural Reflexes

You avoid explosions with reflexes a cat would envy. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Reflex save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.
