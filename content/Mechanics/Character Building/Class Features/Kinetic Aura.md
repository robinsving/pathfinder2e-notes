# Kinetic Aura

Through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame stars of raw metal always changing shape, floatin snowflakes or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura.

You have the [[Channel Elements]] action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura.
