# Thaumaturgic Expertise

You've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to expert.

You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.
