# Field Discovery (Toxicologist)

You learn a special discovery depending on your field.

When using [[Advanced Alchemy]] to make poisons during your daily preparations, you can spend one batch of [[Infused Reagents|reagents]] to create three poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the same poison.
