# Zon-Kuthon

Once a god of art, beauty, and music, like Shelyn, the Midnight Lord returned from a sojourn in the dark spaces between the planes horribly changed. Zon-Kuthon now teaches the pleasures of pain and darkness.

**Edicts** bring pain to the world, mutilate your body

**Anathema** create permanent or long-lasting sources of light, provide comfort to those who suffer

**Areas of Concern** darkness, envy, loss, and pain
