# Smoke Ball (Lesser)

Activate 1 (manipulate)

* * *

Upon smashing this ball on the ground, you instantly create a screen of thick, opaque smoke in a 5-Foot Burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are Concealed, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.
