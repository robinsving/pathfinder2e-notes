# Grim Trophy (Greater)

**Activate** A (concentrate)

* * *

This talisman comes in many forms, most often a severed piece of a humanoid creature displayed in some gruesome manner. When you activate the trophy, make an Intimidate check to [[Demoralize]] up to three targets, comparing your Intimidation check result to all three of their DCs.
