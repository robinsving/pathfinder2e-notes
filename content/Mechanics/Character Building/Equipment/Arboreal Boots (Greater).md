# Arboreal Boots (Greater)

These soft leather boots are embossed with simple woodland scenes. The boots grant a +2 item bonus to Acrobatics and allow you to ignore difficult terrain from plants and fungi.

You also gain a 10-foot climb Speed while climbing plants or fungi and don't need to use your hands to Climb them.
