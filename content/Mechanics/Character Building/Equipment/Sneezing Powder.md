# Sneezing Powder

You can toss sneezing powder at an adjacent creature as an Interact action. The target must attempt a DC 15 fortitude save to avoid sneezing. On a failed save, the creature sneezes uncontrollably, becoming [[Slowed]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is instead slowed 1 for 3 rounds.
