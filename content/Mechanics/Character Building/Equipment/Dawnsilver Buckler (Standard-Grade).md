# Dawnsilver Buckler (Standard-Grade)

Dawnsilver shields are 1 Bulk lighter than normal (or light Bulk if their normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on a shield that normally has light Bulk). When used for a shield bash, they're treated as silver weapons.

The shield has Hardness 3, HP 12, and BT 6.

**Craft Requirements** mithral worth at least 50 gp
