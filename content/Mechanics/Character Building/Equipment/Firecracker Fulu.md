# Firecracker Fulu

**Activate** f envision

**Trigger** You critically succeed at an attack roll with the affixed weapon.

* * *

The fulu explodes and showers the area with bright sparks. The creature struck takes an additional 1d4 sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 15 fortitude save or be [[Dazzled]] for 1 round (or dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure).
