# Flying Talon

This weapon consists of a three-pronged barbed hook attached to a length of chain. It can be used as a melee weapon to stab at foes or hurled as a ranged weapon. Some kobolds are particularly fond of using flying talons, especially as a sort of badge of office above those who serve them.
