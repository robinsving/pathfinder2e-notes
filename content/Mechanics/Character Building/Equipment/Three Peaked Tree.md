# Three Peaked Tree

A recently developed weapon created for an elven champion from Jinin, the three-peaked tree can be used as both a [[Trident]] and a [[Mithral Tree]]. A three-peaked tree has a length of silken rope attached to the butt of its haft, allowing it to be quickly retrieved after thrown.
