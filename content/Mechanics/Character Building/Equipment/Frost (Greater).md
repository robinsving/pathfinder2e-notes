# Frost (Greater)

This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. It deals an additional 1d6 cold damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Slowed]] until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC 34 fortitude save.

Cold damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's cold resistance.
