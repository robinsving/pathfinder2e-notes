# Tracker's Goggles (Greater)

These lenses of forest-green glass are bound in rough leather stitched with crude twine.

While wearing these goggles, you gain a +2 bonus to Survival checks to Sense Direction and Track.

If you fail a check to Track, you can try again after 15 minutes rather than an hour.
