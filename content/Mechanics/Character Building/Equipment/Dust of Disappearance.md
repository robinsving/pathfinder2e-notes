# Dust of Disappearance

This powder shimmers like a thousand tiny motes of light. Activating the dust by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach casts a 4th-level _[[Invisibility]]_ spell with a duration of 1 minute on that creature. This invisibility can't be negated or seen through by any spell of 3rd level or lower or any item of 5th level or lower.

**Activate** A Interact
