# Starshot Arrow (Lesser)

The metal of these arrows is said to have come from a star that ventured too close to Golarion and was shot down by a moonlit archer. When you activate and shoot a starshot arrow, you take no range penalties against any target that you can personally detect. There must be a line of effect between you and the target.

The target must be within the maximum range of your weapon.
