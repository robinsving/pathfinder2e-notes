# Golden-Cased Bullet (Greater)

**Ammunition** round

**Activate** 1 envision

* * *

The magic-infused metal of this bullet's golden casing allows it to curve just a bit in flight once the bullet has been fired, allowing you to ignore the bonus to AC granted to a target in standard or lesser cover.
