# Harrow Mat

This leather mat bears intricate designs and symbols embossed into them to enhance the mystique of a harrow reading. The mat provides a +1 item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and relevant Lore checks (such as Fortune-Telling Lore or Harrow Lore) to convince a creature that a harrow reading was accurate.
