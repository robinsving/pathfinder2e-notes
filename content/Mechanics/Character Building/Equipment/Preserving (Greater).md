# Preserving (Greater)

_Preserving runes_ are common among merchants and other travelers who are on the road for weeks or months at a time. Any non-magical food and drink inside a container with a _greater_ _preserving rune_ never spoils. This feature doesn't prolong the duration of alchemical items.

**Activate**2 command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The container casts _[[Cleanse Cuisine]]_ on all the food and drink within.
