# Jack's Tattered Cape

This ragged, mud-stained cape closes with a single black button engraved with a leering devil's face. When you [[Leap]], [[High Jump]], or [[Long Jump]] (or Vault, if you're Spring-Heeled Jack), you gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]] until the start of your next turn.
