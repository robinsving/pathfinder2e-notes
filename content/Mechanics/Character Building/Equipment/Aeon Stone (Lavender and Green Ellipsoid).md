# Aeon Stone (Lavender and Green Ellipsoid)

This functions as a pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone, but it casts an 8th-level _[[Dispel Magic]]_ spell with a counteract modifier of `dice: 1d20+31`.

The resonant power allows you to cast _[[Detect Magic]]_ and _[[Read Aura]]_ as arcane innate spells at will.
