# Shauth Lash

This metal chain bears hook-like barbs made of alchemically strengthened urdefhan teeth. Magical shauth lashes have the same ability to channel an urdefhan wielder's Wicked Bite as magical shauth blades, and urdefhans hold these weapons with the same reverence as they do shauth blades.
