# Zephyr Guard
You are one of the Zephyr Guard, professional soldiers who protect Katapesh from military threats, economic sabotage, and elite thieves.

## [[Zephyr Guard Dedication]] Feat 2

As a Zephyr Guard, you're always vigilant against crime and threats to the city's safety. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against attempts to Palm an Object, Steal, or Conceal an Object (including you're Seeking concealed objects). You become trained in Society and Katapesh Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Zephyr Guard archetype.

## [[Know the Beat]] Feat 3

**Prerequisites** [[Zephyr Guard Dedication]]

* * *

You become trained in your choice of Guild Lore, Legal Lore, Mercantile Lore, or Underworld Lore. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to Gather Information and to checks made to investigate crimes.

## [[Decry Thief]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** [[Zephyr Guard Dedication]], trained in Intimidation

* * *

When you attempt to Demoralize, you can make it harder for the target to flee, in place of the action's normal effects.

**Critical Success** For 1 round, the target takes a -10-foot status penalty to Speed and a -4 status penalty to Stealth.

**Success** For 1 round, the target takes a -5-foot status penalty to Speed and a -2 status penalty to Stealth.

## [[Relentless Disarm]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** [[Zephyr Guard Dedication]], trained in Athletics

* * *

When you succeed, but don't critically succeed, at a check to Disarm a creature, your circumstance bonus to further checks to Disarm that creature is +4 instead of +2. Other creatures gain only the normal bonus.

When you critically succeed at a Disarm check, you can immediately Demoralize your target as a reaction.

## [[Unfazed Assessment]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** [[Zephyr Guard Dedication]], expert in Perception

* * *

You have witnessed hundreds of fighting styles and quickly adapt to defend against complicated maneuvers. Choose a creature within 30 feet who you're aware of, and attempt a Perception check against that target's Will DC. If you succeed, you size up their fighting style, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against that creature's attacks (or a +2 circumstance bonus for a critical success). These benefits last until the end of your next turn.
