# Alkenstar Agent
Outwardly dashing outlaws or silent, deadly bravos, these masters of combat and culture must hone a variety of skills to serve as secret agents and informants for the leader of Alkenstar, Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Plant Evidence]], [[Quick Draw]]; 6th [[Reactive Pursuit]], [[Running Reload]]; 10th [[Snap Shot]]; 18th [[Instant Opening]]

## [[Alkenstar Agent Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Deception and at least one firearm

**Access** You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.

* * *

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in Deception and trained in your choice of Underworld Lore or Legal Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Lie to Me|Lie To Me]] skill feat.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Alkenstar Agent archetype.

## [[Loose Cannon]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Alkenstar Agent Dedication

* * *

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The Strike gains the following failure effect.

* * *

**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.

**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes broken, and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a @Template\[type:burst|distance:20\] centered on the firearm, with a @Check\[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true\] against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.

## [[Prepare Papers]] Feat 7

**Prerequisites** Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in Society

* * *

You're practiced at creating forgeries that establish your outlaw credentials or augment your legal authority. You can [[Create Forgery]] as an exploration activity. It takes you about 1 hour per page of the document that you're forging. This time is reduced to 10 minutes per page if you're legendary in Society.

## [[Flash Your Badge]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in Intimidation

* * *

You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll Intimidation checks to [[Demoralize]] each creature in a @Template\[type:cone|distance:30\]. When you do so, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.
