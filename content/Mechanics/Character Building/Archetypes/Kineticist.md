# Kineticist
You have, intentionally or accidentally, awoken a gateway to elemental power inside yourself and can now channel that power to devastating effect, adding an elemental arsenal to your abilities

### Multiclass Kineticist Characters

Kineticist is a great fit for characters with high Constitution who want to add some magical blasting to their repertoire without managing the complexity of spell slots. Kineticist impulses can also provide damage types that are useful against certain creatures and special utility abilities such as better movement or battlefield control.

Champions looking to diversify their capabilities, barbarians with the Moment of Clarity feat, and particularly stout druids might all find suitable options.

## [[Kineticist Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Constitution +2

* * *

You become trained in kineticist class DC and impulse attack rolls. Choose one element to be your kinetic element (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood). You gain a kinetic aura and the [[Channel Elements]] action, though you don't get to use an [[Elemental Blast]] or stance impulse when you take that action. You gain the Elemental Blast action. Your Elemental Blast does not automatically gain additional damage dice every four levels, instead requiring you to take the [[Improved Elemental Blast]] feat.

## [[Base Kinesis]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Kineticist Dedication

* * *

You gain the Base Kinesis impulse. For the purposes of determining when the range and Bulk improvements of the action occur, your kineticist level is equal to half your level (for example, Base Kinesis for a 10th-level character with this feat would have a range of 45 feet and could affect 1 Bulk of their chosen element).

## [[Through the Gate]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Kineticist Dedication

* * *

You gain a 1st- or 2nd-level kineticist feat of your choice. Your options include impulse feats for your kinetic element, as normal for a kineticist.

## [[Advanced Element Control]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Through the Gate

* * *

You gain one kineticist feat. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your kineticist level is equal to half your level. Your options include impulse feats for your kinetic element, as normal for a kineticist.

* * *

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain another kineticist feat.

## [[Improved Elemental Blast]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Kineticist Dedication

* * *

The power of your elemental blast improves. The damage of your elemental blast increases by one die.

* * *

**Special** You can take Improved Elemental Blast a second time at 14th level to increase your Elemental Blast to three damage die, and a third time at 18th level to increase your Elemental Blast to four damage die.

## [[Add Element]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Advanced Element Control

* * *

Choose a second kinetic element to add to the one you already have. You gain an impulse feat for that element. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your kineticist level is equal to half your level. If you gain more kineticist feats, you can select hybrid impulses that have both your elements, as normal for a kineticist.

## [[Expert Kinetic Control]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Kineticist Dedication

* * *

You become an expert in kineticist class DC and impulse attack rolls.
