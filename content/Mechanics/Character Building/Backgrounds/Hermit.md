# Hermit

In an isolated place--like a cave, remote oasis, or secluded mansion--you lived a life of solitude. Adventuring might be a welcome reprieve from solitude or an unwanted change, but in either case, you're likely still rough around the edges.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Nature or Occultism skill, plus a Lore skill related to the terrain you lived in as a hermit (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
