# Grave Robber

Resurrectionist. Body snatcher. No matter what you're called, you know where the bodies are buried, and how many coins they'll fetch when dug up. Adventuring comes naturally to you-in your mind dungeons are just oversized tombs-as does returning home with your loot undetected.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Experienced Smuggler]] skill feat.
