# Gladiator

The bloody games of the arena taught you the art of combat. Before you attained true fame, you departed--or escaped--the arena to explore the world. Your skill at drawing both blood and a crowd's attention pay off in a new adventuring life.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the [[Impressive Performance]] skill feat.
