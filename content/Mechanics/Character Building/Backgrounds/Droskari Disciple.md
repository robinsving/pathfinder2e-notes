# Droskari Disciple

You grew up in the church of the Dark Smith, where you learned the value of hard work and achieving vocational mastery.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [[Skill Training]] skill feat, and you're trained in the Droskar Lore skill.
