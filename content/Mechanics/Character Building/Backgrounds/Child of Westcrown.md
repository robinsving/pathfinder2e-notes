# Child of Westcrown

**Prerequisite** Region - Old Cheliax

* * *

Whether you come from Westcrown or elsewhere, you hold the values of pre-Thrune Cheliax dear. You disdain the infernal government, but you are proud of your country and do not consider yourself a rebel.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Westcrown Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
