# Cliffscale Lizardfolk

Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing.

You gain the [[Combat Climber]] feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren't wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free.

Additionally, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
