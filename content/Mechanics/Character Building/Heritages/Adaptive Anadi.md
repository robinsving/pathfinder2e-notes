# Adaptive Anadi

You descend from a line of anadi who worked to perfect their transformation magic, allowing them to integrate into a wider variety of cultures. Choose a common, Medium humanoid ancestry. Your human form is replaced with a form that matches this choice. You also gain the [[Adopted Ancestry]] feat for your chosen humanoid ancestry.
