# Frilled Lizardfolk

You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the [[Threatening Approach]] action.
