***
A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you are when you cast the spell to the line's opposite end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering.  
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature can't move against the wind.  
**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Prone]]. If it was flying, it suffers the effects of critical failure instead.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind's direction, knocked Prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
