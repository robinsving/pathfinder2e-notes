Isger, located in southwestern Avistan on the continent of Golarion, is a nation with a tumultuous history. Once a vassal state of [[Cheliax]], Isger gained independence during the Chelish Civil War but later fell under control of the hobgoblin warlord, Grask Uldeth. After years of oppression, Isger finally regained independence thanks to a rebellion led by the legendary hero, Kining Targgut.

The nation's landscape consists of dense forests, rolling hills, and the foothills of the Five Kings Mountains. Its economy relies on agriculture, lumber, and trade along the Conerica River. Isger's capital is Elidir, a bustling city known for its vibrant markets and skilled craftsmen.

Despite its struggles, Isger remains a resilient nation, striving for stability and prosperity in the face of adversity.
