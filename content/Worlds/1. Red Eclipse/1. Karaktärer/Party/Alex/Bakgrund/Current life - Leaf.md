I don’t wake.

I am called… but I refuse.

Being awakened only means being in pain, so I stay. I can sense my family around me. They do not like that I am refusing the call. It could be the Green Men.

I do not care. I struggle to stay in my spiritual form.

The ritual pulls me and I refuse.

The ritual drags me and still I refuse.

My family pushes me. I would cry if I had tears, and scream if I had a mouth.

I wake.

I wonder where I am. I wonder who I am. I try to recall what I am, but nothing comes to me. Only a word that I do not know. Leshy. No one is here. I am all alone. I don't like being alone, but I don't know why. I see a corpse by the edge of the large circle that surrounds me. It looks old. Among its remains there is a stone with a weird shape. I like stones - it is my stone. The corpse has a bag, it is my bag. I look at the corpse.. Is it my corpse? Yes, but it is too heavy.
I make a joke about a corpse carrying its own bones. I laugh, even though I don't get the joke.

There is a sound from the jungle, behind those Ipê trees. Perhaps something dangerous. I try to fly away into the sky, but I can't. I have to run instead. I hide and stay hidden. One week.

I start to remember some things. What I am. Magic. That I cannot fly. Some days I forget things I have learned the day before. It is like my mind is shattered. At least it becomes easier to stay hidden. Two weeks.

I see the Night Hag. She is a dangerous one. She follows a group of mortals, so I follow her. That’s stupid, I should run. She changes her body so it looks different and then she talks to someone. Tries to trick them. I turn to run away - better she kills them than me. As I turn I trip on an acorn and lose my balance. I fall out from my hiding spot, but land on my feet. I am always like that, both unlucky and lucky.

The Hag sees me. Unlucky.

I do not fight alone. Lucky.
