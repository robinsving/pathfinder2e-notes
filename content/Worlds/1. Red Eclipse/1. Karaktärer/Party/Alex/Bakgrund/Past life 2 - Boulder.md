I wake up.

The Green Men are there. They want us to talk to a dragon who is burning the forest. It has been a long time since I last was awakened.

I am a boulder. The Green Men say stone do not burn. They say this is good. My family are not boulders. We take what we are given.

We march. It is good to walk with others of my kind. One Green Man leads us to the mountain where the dragon lives.

We climb. This body is not good at climbing. I feel tired in the body. Like it is heavy when I do more climbing. I wish to fly up instead.

We climb to the top and talk to the dragon. It talks back. I do not understand the words. They are not my words. The Green Man talks. My family talks. The dragon breathes. They burn. It looks at me. I am afraid, but I cannot burn. It hits me with the tail so I fly far. Flying feels so good. I stop falling when I hit stone. It hurts. The dragon flies away.

I look for my family. No family.

I look for the dragon. No dragon.

No one is around me. I feel alone. Again. I don't like to be alone. I think of flying again.

I go to the edge. I look down. I see the forest far away. I must not fly. I must go down. I must tell them of the dragon.

I turn around to go. I slip on a small loose rock.

I fall.
