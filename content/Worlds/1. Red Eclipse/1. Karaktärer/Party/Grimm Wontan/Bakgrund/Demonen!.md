[[Grimm]] panted hard. The struggle had lasted probably less than a minute but still he found himself winded.

His questions swirled so fast in his mind that he wouldn't have been able to answer them even if he had tried. Why am I so out of breath? Am I this untrained? When was the last time I did my daily training regimen? Why was I attacked by a demon in the middle of Absalom?

And who the hell is this man shaking me?

>Release me!

The grip loosened and Grimm felt his knees start to give way, but managed to keep himself from falling.

>I said 'who are you', the other man exclaimed.

Grimm finally got a good look at the man in front of him. A scrubby old face, elven most likely, covered in road grime looked back at him. He was clad in a weird, dark armour which looked somewhat familiar. The man was tall and despite the gaunt face had managed to lift Grimm off of the ground, and he had a facial expression that could - and just did - scare away a demon.

> My name is Grimm, stranger, and you have my thanks for interceding. I would not have lasted much longer.
> -  True. That demon was very..Â  intent on killing you it would seem. Why would that be, do you think? Did it say anything to you?

The question seemed so absurd, but Grimm genuinely tried to think about it. Would anyone hate him so much that they would send a demon after him. After some quick deliberation he came to the conclusion that a lot of people had reason to hate him, but only a few strongly enough to actually want him dead. Of those, the likelihood of them stooping to occultism or devilish deals was zero.

> No. No one I know would have sent that _thing_ after me. Perhaps it was just a case of wrong time, wrong place.
> -  Hmm. Perhaps. Nevertheless I will look into it. You were lucky I was close enough to sense it.
> How can I repay you? You saved my life after all.

Grimm dropped his newly found shield as he stretched out his other hand to the man.

>  No reward required...

The shield landed in a large puddle on the ground as the man grasped Grimm's hand and a big load of muck ended up on the man's armour.

>  There is.. eh.. this.. is my job..

Something in the man's demeanour had suddenly changed. Grimm could now see slight hints of.. something. Chock? Anger?

>  What did you say you name was, son?

His voice was sterner now than just a moment before.

> I didn't, but it is Grimm Wontan. I'm so sorry about th-
> - Hwon Tan?
> Wontan. Of the Wontan estate outside of the city. If you change your mind about that reward.
>-  Hrm, great. Perhaps I may someday. And you are sure the demon didn't say anything..? No? Well then, farewell young Grimm.

He turned to leave.

> Wait, what is your name?
>-  People call me Zelphar.

After the man had left, Grimm picked up the shield from the ground and then continued his trek home a lot wearier in his steps. He saw more demons in the shadows the next alley he passed, until light sources revealed them to be just that, shadows. Still he felt like he was being watched. And he felt tired. Whatever reprieve his body had given from its drunken state during the attack was now leaving him and instead being replaced by a pounding headache.

>  I really need to stop drinking.
