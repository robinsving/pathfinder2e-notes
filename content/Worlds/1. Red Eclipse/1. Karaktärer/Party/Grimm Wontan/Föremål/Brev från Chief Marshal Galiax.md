Sargent Grimm,

You have done well to gather the information and contact us, and frankly you've been very lucky as well. What you describe here is nothing other than a Derghodaemon, a prince of the daemonic plains. You are under no circumstances to engage with it, any such altercation would just result in your death or worse.

You are to withdraw to a safe distance, a day out of Breachill at least, and find a high vantage point from where you can observe the town.

We have long wanted to gain a foothold in the Cheliax Empire but been unable to do so. If we act correctly this might finally be the chance we have been waiting for, even if it is in the backwaters of the backwater region of Isger. It won't be easy however, a force large enough to deal with a prince of the plains would not be tolerated, not by Isger and especially not by the Cheliax Empire.Â Therefor by the time this reach you we will have established a force in the mountains, close to the Druma boarder. That should be within striking distance from Breachill, allowing us to catch it before Cheliax can muster a force to resist it themselves. But we will need to know when to strike.

You are therefor instructed to remain at your vantage point and keep and eye on the town. When the daemon breaks free, you must wait until it has caused sufficient damage (a few blocks of the town should be enough) and has begun feasting on the population. Then break the seal included in this letter, that will alert our force to begin the strike.

It is absolutely critical for the success of this mission that the damage to Breachill is vast and the loss of life is undeniable, else Cheliax will be able to claim us as illegal invaders. The few survivors must hail our force as their saviors, and sing the praise of the order. If the prince shows any sign on leaving the town before our strike force arrives you must stop it from doing so, even if it means putting yourself at risk.

For the glory of Sarenrae,

Chief Marshal Galiax
