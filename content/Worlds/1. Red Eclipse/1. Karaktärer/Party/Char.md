# Liv och uppväxt
Slum boy från [[Cheliax]] huvudstad. Han kom inte in i matan, för han bodde på gatan.

## Statue

The stone statue now depicts Char fighting a belnot. In one of the tiefling's leg there is a stabbed sword held by the demon, and around his waist there is a flaming whip holding him. Despite this he is holding a horn of the demon in one hand and is seemingly striking down the other hand where he is weilding Char's Eclipse. On the ground between them there are two short swords on the ground. On Char's shoulder stands a bird with its wings spread.

## Plaque

On this spot, in the year 4919 A.R., the tiefling demonslayer Char of Cheliax was slain, while defending the dwarven kingdom of Tanvil and its people from the summoning of a Belnor by their corrupted high priestess. His sacrifice shows us that sometimes the trust in a foreigner should be preferred over that of a kinsman.

He is survived by his companions of The Red Eclipse who carry his memory, always.
