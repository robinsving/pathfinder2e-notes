[[Contessa Lrilatha]]

# Prince Arutha Condoin

Current ruler of Isger, he is said to have dedicated his life to peacefully gain Isger's independence from the empire of Cheliax. With skill and cunning in the game of politics he has managed to make Isger one of the most independent of Cheliax's vassal states, shielding his subjects from Queen Abrogail's darker appetites. He is generally well liked by his people.

# Duke James Jamison

Duke James is one of the few, possibly only, self made nobles of Isger. He was raised into nobility from nothing after foiling a plot on the prince's life and rose to his current rank by applying the skills from his former life as a merchant. He's one of Prince Arutha's closest allies and leader of the secret police.
